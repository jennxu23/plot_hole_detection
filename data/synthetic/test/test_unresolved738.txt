It was a cold and rainy evening when the body of Paul Randolph De Forrest was discovered in his luxurious mansion, brutally murdered. The police arrived promptly at the scene and began their investigation. Among the prime suspects was Franklin Chase, a business associate of the victim who had been seen arguing with De Forrest just days before the crime.Chase, a man of impeccable reputation and well-known in high society circles, seemed to have a flawless alibi. He claimed to have been at his dentist's office at the time of the murder, supported by witnesses and manipulated clocks to corroborate his story. The police, baffled by the seemingly airtight alibi, had no concrete evidence to link Chase to the crime.Enter Professor Augustus S. F. X. Van Dusen, also known as The Thinking Machine, a brilliant and eccentric logician renowned for his unparalleled deductive abilities. The police turned to him for help in unraveling the mystery of De Forrest's murder.The Thinking Machine, with his keen observation skills and logical reasoning, delved into the details of the case. He visited the dentist's office where Chase claimed to have been during the time of the murder and meticulously examined the clocks that had been used as evidence of his alibi. It didn't take long for The Thinking Machine to uncover the subtle tampering with the clocks that had been orchestrated by Chase himself.With this crucial piece of evidence in hand, The Thinking Machine set a clever trap for Chase. He arranged for a false eyewitness to come forward, claiming to have seen Chase exiting De Forrest's mansion on the night of the murder. The witness's account was fabricated, but it was convincing enough to unsettle Chase.
