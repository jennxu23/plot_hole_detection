The Case of the Missing CrownIt was a foggy evening in London when Sherlock Holmes received a letter from Robert Musgrave, the current heir of Hurlstone Manor. The letter detailed a mysterious disappearance at the Manor, involving the butler, Brunton, and a maid named Howells. Intrigued by the case, Holmes and I made our way to the countryside to unravel the mystery that awaited us at Hurlstone Manor.As we arrived at the Manor, Robert Musgrave greeted us anxiously. He led us to the study and recounted the events that had transpired. Brunton and Howells had both disappeared without a trace, leaving the household in disarray. Musgrave suspected foul play and sought Holmes' expertise in solving the case.Holmes, ever the keen observer, began his investigation by examining the room where Brunton had last been seen. He meticulously inspected every detail, from the position of the furniture to the items left behind. It was clear to him that Brunton had left in a hurry, as evidenced by the scattered papers and overturned chair.Next, we visited the room of the missing maid, Howells. Her quarters were neat and tidy, a stark contrast to the chaos in Brunton's room. Holmes carefully examined her belongings, looking for any clues that might shed light on her sudden disappearance.It was during this search that Holmes came across an old family ritual, the Musgrave Ritual, tucked away in a drawer. The ritual contained a series of cryptic questions and answers that piqued Holmes' interest. He deduced that the answers held the key to uncovering the hidden treasure that Brunton and Howells had been seeking.
