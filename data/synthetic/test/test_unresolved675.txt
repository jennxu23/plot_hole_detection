unresolved 0.9
It was a dull and dreary day at 221B Baker Street, with the fog rolling in from the Thames and obscuring the view from Sherlock Holmes' window. I sat across from the great detective as he meticulously examined a collection of seemingly unrelated objects under his trusty microscope. My curiosity piqued, I leaned forward to inquire about his findings.
