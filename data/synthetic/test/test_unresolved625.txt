The air in the London house was heavy with the weight of the crime that had taken place here.As Tatlock began his investigation, he discovered the victim was a woman named Amelia Blackwood, a reclusive artist known for her hauntingly beautiful paintings. The circumstances of her murder were shrouded in mystery, with no apparent motive or suspects to be found. It was as if the darkness of the crime had swallowed all traces of light.As Tatlock delved deeper into the case, a pattern began to emerge—a complex web of deceit and betrayal involving a foreign couple, the Luchessis. The Luchessis had befriended Amelia under the guise of art patrons, but beneath their charming facade lurked a sinister motive. They sought to exploit Amelia's talent for financial gain, and when she refused to comply, they resorted to violence to silence her forever.Following the faint trail of clues left behind, Tatlock's investigation led him across continents, from the bustling streets of London to the sprawling cities of America.
