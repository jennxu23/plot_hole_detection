It was a cold, damp evening when the truth behind Victor Dubois's tragic death came to light. Dorcas, a woman of sharp wit and unwavering determination, invited me and her husband, Paul, to their cozy home to share the full story. The fire crackled in the hearth, casting dancing shadows on the walls as Dorcas began her tale.She spoke of Maud Hargreaves, a young woman of grace and beauty, who had secretly married Victor Dubois, a man of charming demeanor but troubled mind. Maud's love for Victor had blinded her to the darkness that lurked within him, and their whirlwind romance had led to a hasty marriage kept hidden from the prying eyes of society.As Dorcas unraveled the events that followed, we learned that Victor's mental health had deteriorated rapidly after their marriage. He was eventually admitted to a lunatic asylum, leaving Maud devastated and alone. It was during this tumultuous time that Victor's demons consumed him, twisting his once kind heart into a vessel of madness.
