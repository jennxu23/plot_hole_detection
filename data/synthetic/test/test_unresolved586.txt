Miss Isabel Leigh Harding was sitting in her parlor in the late hours of the evening, the room bathed in the soft glow of candlelight. She had just placed her family heirloom, a gold bracelet with a hidden message, in her jewel box for safekeeping. Little did she know that a masked figure was silently making her way through the shadows towards her home, intent on retrieving the valuable bracelet.As Miss Harding sat lost in thought, the masked girl broke into her home with stealth and precision. A revolver glinted in her hand as she confronted Miss Harding, demanding the gold bracelet. Shocked and intimidated, Miss Harding stammered that she had indeed placed the bracelet in her jewel box. However, upon opening the box, they both discovered that the bracelet was missing.
