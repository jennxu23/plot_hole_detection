Detective Wigan had been enjoying a peaceful respite from his usual casework, spending his days attending theater performances and leisurely strolls through the bustling streets of London. However, his tranquility was abruptly shattered when a call came in the middle of the night summoning him to the affluent neighborhood of Hampstead to investigate a brutal murder.The victim was identified as the wealthy German businessman, Mr. Seligmann. As Wigan arrived at the crime scene, he was met with a gruesome sight. Seligmann lay lifeless on the floor of his lavish home, with a stiletto wound piercing his neck and savage claw-like injuries marring his face and throat. The brutality of the attack sent a chill down Wigan's spine, indicating a personal and deeply emotional motive behind the crime.Feeling the weight of the case bearing down on him, Wigan knew he needed the expertise and unconventional insight of his old friend, Christopher Quarles. Quarles, an eccentric and astute man with a knack for solving the most perplexing mysteries, was always up for a challenge. Wigan wasted no time in seeking out Quarles, who arrived at the crime scene with his usual air of intellectual curiosity.After examining the evidence and scrutinizing the details of the murder, Quarles began to piece together a theory. He suspected that the killer was someone close to Seligmann, driven by a deep-seated resentment or hidden animosity towards the victim. To delve deeper into the case, Quarles suggested they visit Seligmann's cottage in Maidenhead, where he spent his weekends away from the hustle and bustle of the city.As they arrived at the tranquil countryside retreat, Quarles's keen observations led him to uncover a series of clues that painted a chilling picture of betrayal and deceit. He discovered hidden letters revealing a tumultuous relationship between Seligmann and his wife, Eliza. The letters spoke of jealousy, infidelity, and a growing sense of desperation on Eliza's part.
