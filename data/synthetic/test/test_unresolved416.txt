On a misty morning in London, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson received a visit from a distressed young woman named Helen Stoner. She recounted the tragic history of her family, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, and the mysterious death of her sister shortly before her own wedding. Helen's face was etched with fear as she described the strange occurrences that had plagued their household.Dr. Grimesby Roylott, Helen's stepfather, was a man of violent temper and unsettling demeanor. He had forbidden Helen from lighting a lamp in her bedroom at night, claiming it disturbed him. Suspicious of his motives, Helen sought the help of Sherlock Holmes to unravel the truth behind her sister's untimely demise.Holmes listened intently, his piercing eyes taking in every detail of Helen's story. He agreed to investigate the matter, and the next day found the detective and his trusty companion, Watson, en route to Stoke Moran, the Roylott family estate.As they arrived at the gloomy manor, Holmes noted the desolate surroundings and the eerie atmosphere that permeated the air. The house itself was imposing, its windows shuttered and the ivy clinging to its walls like a ghostly hand.Upon meeting Dr. Roylott, Holmes observed the man's menacing presence and cold gaze. The doctor's interest in exotic animals, particularly his collection of deadly swamp adders, raised Holmes's suspicions. As they explored the house, Holmes noted the intricate setup of Helen's bedroom, with a bell rope hanging near the bed and a ventilator connected to the adjoining room.
