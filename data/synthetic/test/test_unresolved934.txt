The Chamber of Peace at Highview Manor was a sanctuary of tranquility, a haven where Doctor Dollar retreated to contemplate and rejuvenate his weary mind. With its soft lighting, comfortable furnishings, and the gentle trickling of a nearby fountain, it was a place of solace amidst the chaos of the world outside.One morning, as Doctor Dollar entered the Chamber of Peace, he was startled to find George Edenborough reclined in one of the plush armchairs, seemingly asleep. A tiny phial of prussic acid lay beside him, its ominous presence sending a shiver down Doctor Dollar's spine. Topham Vinson, the estate manager, arrived soon after and gasped in horror at the sight before him."What has happened here?" Topham exclaimed, his brow furrowed with concern.Doctor Dollar knelt beside George, checking his pulse and breathing. "He's not dead," he declared after a moment. "He has not taken the poison. George has merely fallen into a deep slumber."Relief flooded Topham's features, but confusion lingered in his eyes. "But why would George have a phial of prussic acid by his side?"Doctor Dollar rose to his feet and motioned for Topham to sit. "There is more to this situation than meets the eye," he began. "Miss Trevellyn, George's cousin and a talented artist, had confessed to me yesterday that she had been selling copies of George's intricate naval drawings to a man named Rocchi."Topham's eyes widened in astonishment. "But why would Miss Trevellyn do such a thing?"
