Little did they know that the true drama was about to unfold behind the scenes.Dr. Coleman, a respected physician in Ravenwood, had always been regarded as a pillar of the community. But as Mr. Paul Beck, a renowned detective known for his sharp wit and keen observations, had suspected, there was more to Dr. Coleman than met the eye. Beck had been investigating a series of daring robberies and brutal murders that had shaken the town in recent months, and all evidence pointed to Dr. Coleman as the mastermind behind the crimes.Disguised as Bill Pluck, a simple farmer visiting Ravenwood for the first time, Beck had infiltrated the mesmerist's entourage, knowing that Dr. Coleman had a keen interest in the mystical arts. Beck orchestrated a clever plan to use the mesmerist's performance as a means to uncover the truth about Dr. Coleman's dark deeds.As Madame Mirage took the stage, Beck watched closely from the shadows, observing the reactions of the audience and the subtle interactions between the mesmerist and Dr. Coleman. Beck had a keen eye for detail, and he noticed a flicker of recognition in Dr. Coleman's eyes as Madame Mirage began her hypnotic trance.One by one, the volunteers from the audience were brought up on stage to be mesmerized. Beck watched intently as one particular subject, a young man named Thomas, fell into a deep hypnotic state. Under Madame Mirage's influence, Thomas began to speak in a trance-like state, his words disjointed but filled with vivid imagery.
