He arrived at Belmore Park, where the wreckage of the gyroscope machines lay scattered across the field, a stark reminder of the tragedies that had unfolded.As Kennedy meticulously examined the remains of the aircraft, he noted peculiar patterns of damage that seemed inconsistent with a typical mechanical failure. His sharp eyes caught subtle clues—a faint scent of ozone, unusual burn marks, and tiny metal fragments that did not belong to the machines.Determined to uncover the truth, Kennedy delved deeper into Norton's operations, interviewing key personnel and scrutinizing the design and manufacturing processes of the gyroscope machines. It was during one of these interviews that a name caught Kennedy's attention—Lamar, a disgruntled former employee who had been dismissed by Norton for misconduct.Kennedy's instincts told him that Lamar held the key to the mystery. With a sense of urgency, he set out to track down the elusive man, following a trail of breadcrumbs that led him to an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town.As Kennedy cautiously approached the dilapidated building, he felt a surge of electricity in the air—an ominous sign that danger lurked within. With cautious steps, he ventured inside, his senses alert to any sign of movement.In the dimly lit interior, Kennedy's sharp eyes caught sight of Lamar, hunched over a complex contraption of wires and coils—a powerful wireless high-tension electricity device.
