The sun rose over the Gravel Pits Farm, casting a golden hue over the picturesque valley as the two Sandeman brothers, George and David, went about their morning chores. The air was crisp and still, with the only sound being the rustling of leaves and the distant calls of birds.The tranquility of the farm was shattered when news arrived that the railway company was acquiring their land. George and David were forced to confront the reality of losing their home, their livelihood, and their way of life. As the days passed, tension grew between the brothers, with David becoming increasingly despondent.One fateful day, David disappeared without a trace, leaving behind a cloud of suspicion that hung heavy over the farm. George searched tirelessly for his brother, but all efforts to locate him proved fruitless. The community whispered of foul play, of hidden motives, and dark secrets lurking within the walls of Gravel Pits Farm.
