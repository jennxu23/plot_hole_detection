Trembling with fear and desperation, she confessed to accidentally killing a young man in a frantic attempt to retrieve incriminating documents that her husband had hidden away.Holmes listened intently as Mrs. Petrov recounted her harrowing tale. She spoke of her husband's treachery, his betrayal of his comrades, and the guilt that had haunted her ever since.
