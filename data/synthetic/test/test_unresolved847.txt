It was a cold and rainy night when Craig Kennedy received a frantic call from the Navy Department. A vital naval secret had been stolen, and they needed his expertise to unravel the mystery and recover the stolen plans. Craig wasted no time and immediately assembled his team, including his trusted assistant, Gladys Shirley, to delve into the case.The stolen plans were for a revolutionary telautomatic system, a technology that could control ships and weapons remotely. The implications of such a system falling into the wrong hands were dire, and Craig knew they had to act swiftly to prevent any potential disaster.Their investigation led them to a man named Nordheim, a notorious criminal with a penchant for espionage and sabotage. Nordheim had a reputation for selling military secrets to the highest bidder, and it seemed that this time he had his sights set on the telautomatic system. With the help of the secret service, Craig and his team tracked down Nordheim's whereabouts and set out to apprehend him before he could disseminate the stolen plans.As they closed in on Nordheim's hideout, they were met with unexpected resistance. Two Japanese servants, who were revealed to be Nordheim's accomplices, chose to take their own lives rather than face capture. The tragic turn of events only heightened the urgency of the situation, and Craig knew they were on the brink of uncovering a larger conspiracy at play.Through a series of meticulous investigations and clever deductions, Craig and Gladys were able to piece together the puzzle. They discovered that Nordheim was planning to sell the telautomatic system to a foreign power for a hefty sum, putting national security at risk. His accomplices, the Japanese servants, were loyal to him to the end, willing to sacrifice their lives to protect their master's secrets.
