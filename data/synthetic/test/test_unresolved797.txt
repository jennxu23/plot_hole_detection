Miss Polly Burton sat at her favorite corner table in the quaint little cafe, sipping on her coffee and nibbling on a croissant. As she glanced around the room, her eyes landed on a man sitting alone at the back, his sharp gaze fixed on something unseen. Curiosity piqued, she found herself drawn to him, and before she knew it, she was standing by his table."May I join you?" she asked hesitantly, not wanting to intrude.The man looked up, his piercing eyes meeting hers. "Please, have a seat," he replied, a faint smile playing on his lips.As they exchanged pleasantries, Miss Burton couldn't shake off the feeling that there was something intriguing about this man. It wasn't long before the conversation turned to a series of mysterious events involving stolen diamonds from the homes of two wealthy men, Mr. Shipman and Mr. Knopf.
