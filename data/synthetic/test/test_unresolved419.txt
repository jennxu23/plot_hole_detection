Polly sat on the rattling train, her mind consumed by thoughts of the missed meeting with Mr. Frobisher. She had been looking forward to discussing the latest play she had seen at the matinee, but now she was filled with guilt over her absence. The cold coffee in her hand offered no comfort as she tried to shake off the feeling of unease that had settled in her stomach.As the train rumbled through the dark tunnels of the Underground Railway, a sudden commotion caught Polly's attention. A group of passengers had gathered around a figure slumped in a seat, their murmurs of concern filling the air. Polly's curiosity piqued, she made her way through the crowd to see what was happening.A strange old man sat in the seat, his eyes closed and his breathing shallow. A sense of foreboding washed over Polly as she watched the scene unfold. The passengers whispered in hushed tones, speculating about the man's condition and what could have caused it.When the train came to a stop at the next station, the old man was carried off by attendants, leaving behind an eerie silence in his wake. Polly couldn't shake the feeling that something sinister had just occurred, but she pushed the thought to the back of her mind as she continued on her journey.It wasn't until the following day that Polly learned the shocking truth. The old man had died on the train, and the cause of death was revealed to be prussic acid poisoning.
