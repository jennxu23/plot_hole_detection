It was a foggy night in London, the gas lamps casting a dim glow over the cobbled streets. Inside the grand Malwood Manor, a gruesome discovery had been made. Sir Edward Malwood, a wealthy and respected gentleman, lay dead in his study, a heavy paper-weight next to his lifeless body. The news spread like wildfire, and soon the police were called to investigate the mysterious murder.Detective Mr. Beck was assigned to the case, known for his keen eye for detail and sharp mind. As he combed through the evidence, one name kept coming up - Albert Malwood, the nephew of the deceased. Albert had been at odds with his uncle for years, and many believed he had a motive to commit the heinous crime.As Mr. Beck delved deeper into the family dynamics, a new piece of evidence emerged - a letter from Albert's wife, Annie. In the letter, Annie described their dire financial situation, her failing health, and begged for help from Sir Edward. It became clear that Albert had been disinherited by his uncle, who had left everything to him instead of his own son, creating a strong motive for Albert to stop any chance of reconciliation.
