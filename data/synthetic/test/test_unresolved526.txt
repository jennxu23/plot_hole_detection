On a cold, misty evening, the Orient Express chugged along its tracks, carrying its passengers through the darkened countryside. Among them was Lord Stavornell, a wealthy aristocrat known for his sharp wit and elegant demeanor. But as the train rumbled on, tragedy struck in the form of a murder.When the train pulled into the station at Ipswich, the station-master was shocked to find Lord Stavornell slumped in his compartment, a single gunshot wound to his temple. The evidence seemed to point towards suicide – a gun in his hand, a note of despair on the table. But the station-master's instincts told him otherwise. He immediately called for Detective Cleek, known for his keen eye and sharp mind.As Detective Cleek examined the scene, he noticed subtle inconsistencies that hinted at foul play. The angle of the gunshot wound, the position of Lord Stavornell's body – everything seemed too neat, too staged. Cleek's suspicions deepened as he uncovered a forged note, supposedly from Lord Stavornell's estranged daughter, pleading for a reconciliation.
