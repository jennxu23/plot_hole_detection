It was a dark and stormy night when Professor Augustus S.F.X. Van Dusen, also known as The Thinking Machine, received a mysterious phone call that would thrust him into a perilous situation. The phone rang shrilly, cutting through the silence of the night, and the professor, always intrigued by puzzles, answered with his characteristic precision."Professor Van Dusen," a voice whispered urgently, "you must come quickly. There's been a crimeâ€”a grave crime!"Van Dusen's analytical mind immediately sprang into action. Without hesitation, he made his way to the predetermined location, a bank in the heart of the city, where the caller awaited him in the shadows.As he approached the bank, a sense of foreboding gripped Van Dusen. Something was amiss, he could feel it in the air. The caller, a nervous man by the name of Harry Cranston, led him inside the bank under the cover of darkness.
