Reginald Hewitt, a renowned private investigator known for his sharp eye and keen intuition, found himself facing one of his most challenging cases yet. The theft of valuable torpedo designs belonging to engineer F. Graham Dixon had left the authorities baffled, but Hewitt was determined to unravel the mystery.Upon examining the scene of the crime at Dixon's workshop, Hewitt noticed subtle clues that pointed towards an inside job. His trained eye picked up on small details that others might have overlooked - a misplaced tool, a smudge on a blueprint, and a faint odor of tobacco that lingered in the air. These observations led him to suspect that someone close to Dixon was involved in the theft.After interviewing Dixon and his assistants, Hewitt honed in on two key suspects - Ritter and Mirsky. Ritter, a quiet and unassuming subordinate tracer, seemed nervous and evasive during questioning, while Mirsky, a smooth-talking steam-packing agent, appeared overly eager to assist in the investigation.Hewitt decided to focus his attention on Ritter, sensing that he might hold the key to unraveling the case. Through a series of cleverly disguised inquiries and strategic manipulation, Hewitt managed to gain Ritter's trust and coax out the truth.
