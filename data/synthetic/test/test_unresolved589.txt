Kennedy, a renowned detective known for his sharp mind and keen observations, was enjoying a quiet evening at his office when Dr. Burnham, a trusted friend and colleague, came bursting through the door with a look of urgency on his face."Kennedy, I need your help with a most peculiar case," Dr. Burnham exclaimed as he handed Kennedy a file filled with medical reports and notes. "It involves an eccentric old millionaire, Stephen Haswell, who has suddenly gone blind and his health is deteriorating rapidly."Intrigued by the mysterious circumstances surrounding Mr. Haswell's condition, Kennedy wasted no time in delving into the details of the case. As he pored over the documents, he noticed a mention of Mr. Haswell's estranged daughter, Grace, who had not been in touch with her father for many years.
