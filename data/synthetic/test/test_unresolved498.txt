Professor Augustus S.F.X. Van Dusen, known to many as The Thinking Machine, sat in his dimly lit study, his sharp eyes fixed on the man sitting across from him. The man, disheveled and anxious, had introduced himself as John Doane, claiming to have lost his memory and seeking the professor's help in unraveling the mystery of his identity."Do you remember anything at all about your past, Mr. Doane?" The Thinking Machine inquired, his voice as sharp as his intellect.Doane shook his head, his hands trembling slightly. "Nothing, Professor. It's as if my entire life has been wiped clean from my mind. All I know is that I woke up in a hotel room with no recollection of who I am or how I got there."The Thinking Machine nodded thoughtfully, his mind already racing through the possibilities. He began to ask Doane a series of questions, probing for any sliver of information that might shed light on his true identity. As the interrogation continued, The Thinking Machine noticed a flicker of recognition in Doane's eyes when the word "copper" was mentioned."Copper, copper, copper," repeated Doane, his voice tinged with a mix of confusion and excitement. "It means something to me, but I can't quite grasp it."The mention of copper piqued The Thinking Machine's interest. He knew there was more to the story than met the eye.
