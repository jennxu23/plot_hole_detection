Mr. Hewitt stood in the study at Wedbury Hall, his keen eyes scanning the room for any clue that could lead him to the missing will. The atmosphere was tense, with Mr. Crellan pacing back and forth anxiously, hoping for a breakthrough in the case that had been haunting them for days.As Mr. Hewitt examined the bureau where the will was last seen, he noticed a faint residue of dust on one of the drawers. A telltale sign that someone had recently tampered with it. He turned to Mr. Crellan and said, "I believe someone has been here, and they may have taken the will."Mr. Crellan's eyes widened in shock. "But who would do such a thing? And why?""It's clear that someone has been manipulating the situation," Mr. Hewitt replied. "And I suspect that Miss Garth may be a victim of hypnotic suggestion.""Hypnotic suggestion?" Mr. Crellan repeated, incredulous."Yes, it's a powerful tool when used by someone with ill intentions," Mr. Hewitt explained. "I believe Cranley Mellis has been using it to control Miss Garth and make her do his bidding without her knowledge."Mr. Crellan's face paled at the revelation. "But how can we prove this? And how do we stop him?""We need to act quickly and cleverly," Mr. Hewitt said, his mind already formulating a plan. "First, we must find the will and then confront Mellis with our evidence."With a renewed sense of determination, Mr. Hewitt and Mr. Crellan began a thorough search of the house, checking every possible hiding place where the will could be concealed. After hours of meticulous investigation, they finally found the will in a hidden recess in the small staircase."Here it is," Mr. Crellan exclaimed, relief flooding his features. "But what about Mellis? How do we expose him?""We need to set a trap," Mr. Hewitt said, a glint of mischief in his eyes. "I have a plan that will reveal Mellis's true intentions and put an end to his manipulative ways."As night fell, Mr. Hewitt set his plan in motion. He arranged for Miss Garth to be sent out for a ride with the groom, leaving Mellis alone in the house. Meanwhile, he and Mr. Crellan hid in the study, waiting for Mellis to make his move.Sure enough, as expected, Mellis appeared in the study, his eyes darting around the room in search of the will. Mr. Crellan held his breath as Mellis approached the bookcase where the will had been hidden earlier.
