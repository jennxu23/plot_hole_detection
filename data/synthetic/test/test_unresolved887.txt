Carroll Garland rubbed his eyes in disbelief as he stared at the figure of a man in his room, rifling through his belongings as if he owned the place. The stranger, impeccably dressed in evening attire, turned to face Garland with a calm demeanor that belied the audacity of his actions."I must apologize, Mr. Garland," the man began in a smooth voice. "I have taken the money you won at the bridge game earlier this evening. It was a matter of necessity, I assure you."Garland raised an eyebrow, more intrigued than angry at the unexpected turn of events. "Well, I must say, you have a unique way of asking for a loan," he remarked wryly. "But I'm afraid I cannot let you leave with my winnings without a challenge."With that, Garland lunged towards the intruder, determined to reclaim what was rightfully his. The room erupted into a chaotic scuffle as the two men grappled with each other, knocking over furniture and creating a commotion that surely would have woken the entire hotel.Unfortunately for Garland, the intruder proved to be more skilled in hand-to-hand combat, landing a swift blow that sent him reeling to the ground, darkness clouding his vision as he slipped into unconsciousness.When Garland finally regained awareness, he found himself alone in his room, the intruder nowhere to be seen. To his surprise, the money he had won at the bridge game was neatly stacked on the bedside table, accompanied by an unsigned note of thanks.Perplexed by the strange turn of events, Garland decided to seek the help of Detective Mallory, a seasoned investigator known for his sharp instincts and dogged determination. Sensing the complexity of the case, Detective Mallory suggested enlisting the expertise of Professor Augustus S.F.X. Van Dusen, a brilliant and eccentric scholar renowned for his unparalleled deductive skills.Upon meeting with the professor, Garland recounted the bizarre events of that fateful night, hoping that together they could unravel the mystery behind the intruder's actions. Professor Van Dusen, with his keen intellect and unconventional methods, immediately set to work analyzing the clues at hand.After days of meticulous investigation and deduction, the truth behind the strange incident began to unfold. Through a series of cleverly pieced together evidence, the professor deduced that the intruder had been searching for a compromising letter hidden in the lining of Garland's coat.
