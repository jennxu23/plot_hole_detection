And the case he spoke of that evening was no exception.It all began with the mysterious death of Miss Elliott, a young matron at the Convalescent Home where she worked. Her passing had been ruled as accidental by the authorities, but the man in the corner suspected foul play.As he delved deeper into the investigation, he uncovered a tangled web of deceit and betrayal that implicated two high-ranking officials at the Home - Dr. Kinnaird and Dr. Stapylton.
