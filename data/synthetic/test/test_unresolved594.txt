It was a crisp autumn morning when Miss St. John Mallaby hurried into Thorpe Hazell's office, her eyes filled with distress. Hazell, known for his unconventional dining habits and his keen eye for detail as a railway detective, raised an eyebrow in curiosity at the young woman's appearance."Mr. Hazell, I am in desperate need of your help," Miss Mallaby began, her voice trembling slightly. "I have lost my aunt's precious diamond necklace during a train journey, and I suspect foul play."Hazell leaned back in his chair, his interest piqued. "Tell me everything you remember about the journey, Miss Mallaby. Every detail could be crucial in solving this mystery."As Miss Mallaby recounted the events of her train journey, Hazell listened attentively, noting down key information about the passengers and any suspicious occurrences. One name stood out to him - Mr. Kestron, a charming gentleman who had been seated in the same carriage as Miss Mallaby.Hazell wasted no time and set out to investigate further. He boarded the next train to the same destination, keeping a close eye on Mr. Kestron and his interactions with fellow passengers. It wasn't long before Hazell noticed something amiss - a furtive exchange between Mr. Kestron's valet and a mysterious figure in the shadows of the train platform.
