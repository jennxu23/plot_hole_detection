Detective Fahey sat in the dimly lit interrogation room, facing the two suspects. 'Reddy' Blake, a known troublemaker in town, sat with a look of defiance on his face. Johnson, a soft-spoken man who worked at the local hardware store, appeared nervous and fidgety. The recent turn of events had left everyone in the room on edge.The Thinking Machine, a brilliant and eccentric consultant detective, had been brought in to assist with the baffling case of Miss Gorham's murder. His keen observations and deductive reasoning had led them to this moment, where the true killer was about to be revealed.Fahey cleared his throat, breaking the tense silence in the room. "Johnson, you've heard 'Reddy's' confession. Do you have anything to say?"Johnson shifted in his seat, his eyes darting nervously between 'Reddy' and the detective. Finally, he spoke in a shaky voice. "I... I didn't do it. I swear, I didn't kill Miss Gorham."'Reddy' let out a derisive snort. "Oh, come on, Johnson. We both know the truth. I saw you do it with my own eyes."The chief, who had been observing the interrogation from behind a one-way mirror, entered the room. He turned to Fahey, his expression grave. "What do we do now, Detective?"Fahey glanced at The Thinking Machine, who was watching the proceedings with an inscrutable expression. "We follow his lead. Separate the two suspects and tell each of them that the other has confessed. Let's see what happens."The chief nodded in agreement and gave the order to his officers. Johnson was taken to one cell while 'Reddy' was placed in another. Both men were informed that the other had confessed to the murder of Miss Gorham.As Johnson sat alone in his cell, his mind raced. He knew he was innocent, but would anyone believe him? The weight of the situation pressed down on him like a heavy stone.Meanwhile, 'Reddy' sat in his own cell, a smug grin on his face. He was convinced that Johnson would crack under the pressure and admit to the crime.Hours passed, and the tension in the police station was palpable. Finally, Fahey and the chief returned to the interrogation room. The Thinking Machine was already there, his eyes sharp and focused."Well, Detective, what have we learned?" Fahey asked.The Thinking Machine leaned back in his chair, a small smile playing on his lips. "Johnson is innocent. He did not kill Miss Gorham."'Reddy' let out a bark of laughter. "Ha! I knew it! I told you he was the one!"The chief raised an eyebrow. "But how can you be so sure, Thinking Machine?"The detective turned his piercing gaze on 'Reddy'.
