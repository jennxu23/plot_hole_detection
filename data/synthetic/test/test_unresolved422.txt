The sun was setting as I made my way through the bustling streets of London towards the Italian Embassy. The Italian Ambassador had summoned me, a detective by profession, to prevent a theft during a visit from a delegation from Italy to Mr. T.A. Edison. The task ahead filled me with a sense of anticipation, as encounters with the late Lord Chizelrigg and the renowned inventor had always led to intriguing mysteries.Upon arriving at the Embassy, I was greeted by the Ambassador himself, who ushered me inside to a grand reception hall where the delegation from Italy was awaiting their audience with Mr. Edison. As I observed the scene, I noticed Mr. Edison engrossed in a discussion about machinery with a French workman, seemingly unaware of the ceremony unfolding around him.The Ambassador proceeded to present honors to Mr. Edison on behalf of the King of Italy, but Mr. Edison's attention remained fixed on the conversation with the workman. It was clear that his passion for innovation overshadowed the formalities of the visit.After the delegation departed, Mr. Edison turned to the workman with enthusiasm, promising to visit his shop and assist in making a particular device work. The genuine interest and dedication Mr. Edison displayed towards the workman struck a chord within me, reminding me of the virtues of patience and hard work that are essential in both the realms of invention and detection.As I reflected on Mr. Edison's approach, my thoughts drifted back to the enigmatic Lord Chizelrigg, whose tale had captivated me with its layers of intrigue and mystery. The young lord had sought my help in unraveling a perplexing situation following the passing of his eccentric uncle, whose peculiar actions had plunged the family into financial turmoil.Lord Chizelrigg's sincerity and willingness to confront the truth about his uncle's actions had left a lasting impression on me. He revealed the strange behavior of his late uncle, who had lived as a recluse and left behind a cryptic note hinting at hidden wealth. The mention of a safe, wallpaper, and French paper used in gold beating had piqued our curiosity, setting us on a path towards solving the mystery.Together, Lord Chizelrigg and I embarked on a meticulous investigation, combing through the uncle's belongings and searching for clues that would lead us to the elusive fortune. Our journey took us through the dimly lit corridors of the Chizelrigg estate, each discovery bringing us closer to uncovering the truth behind the uncle's enigmatic legacy.
