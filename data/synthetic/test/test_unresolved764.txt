The grand ballroom was alive with music and laughter as Dora and Fairleigh swept onto the dance floor, the elegance of their movements catching the eye of every observer. The reunion of the old friends had been a joyous occasion, with Dora's radiant smile lighting up Fairleigh's face in a way that had long been absent.As they glided across the floor in perfect harmony, the conversation turned to Fairleigh's latest invention – a contraption that allowed humans to experience the exhilarating sensation of flight. His eyes sparkled with excitement as he described the intricacies of his invention, the challenges he had faced during its development, and the sheer joy of soaring through the skies."I have actually flown using my invention," Fairleigh revealed to Dora, his voice filled with a mixture of pride and wonder. "It was an experience unlike any other, Dora. To feel the wind rushing past, to see the world from a perspective few have ever known – it was truly breathtaking."Dora listened with rapt attention, her admiration for Fairleigh growing with each word he spoke. However, as the conversation deepened, Fairleigh's tone grew more somber as he confessed the troubles that had come with his groundbreaking invention."I have faced attempts to steal my plans, Dora," Fairleigh admitted, his brow furrowed with worry. "There are those who would stop at nothing to get their hands on my design, to claim my invention as their own. I have taken every precaution, but the threat looms over me like a dark cloud."Dora's heart went out to her friend, and she vowed to stand by him and offer her support in any way she could. Little did she know that her loyalty would soon be put to the test in a way she could never have imagined.Several days after the ball, Fairleigh reached out to Dora in a state of distress. "Dora, my design paper – it's gone," he exclaimed, his voice laced with panic. "I don't know how it happened, but it's nowhere to be found in my office. Without it, all my hard work, all my dreams, will be lost."Dora's sharp intuition immediately kicked into gear as she promised Fairleigh that she would do everything in her power to help him recover the missing paper. With determination in her eyes, she set out to unravel the mystery and bring the thief to justice.After a thorough search of Fairleigh's office turned up empty, Dora decided to pay a visit to Bradley, Fairleigh's loyal clerk. Something about the man's demeanor had always struck her as slightly off, and she couldn't shake the feeling that he might be hiding something.As she entered Bradley's home, her eyes fell upon a dovecot in the corner of the yard, the fluttering of wings catching her attention. With a sinking feeling in her stomach, Dora approached the dovecot and peered inside, her heart racing at what she might find.
