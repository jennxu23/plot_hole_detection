Ever since they moved into their apartment on Twenty-seventh Street, John and Mary had felt a strange presence lingering in the rooms. It started with small things - objects misplaced, a feeling of being watched, and shadows darting in the corners of their eyes. But it wasn't until one fateful night that the eerie occurrences escalated.John had returned home late from work, tired and eager to relax. As he entered the dimly lit apartment, a chill ran down his spine. Mary was not yet home, and the stillness in the air seemed to thicken around him. Ignoring the unease creeping into his mind, he settled down on the couch, trying to distract himself with a book.Suddenly, a figure materialized before him - a woman dressed in outdated clothing, her eyes filled with sorrow and longing. John's heart raced as he watched her glide through the room, her form flickering in and out of existence like a specter. He tried to call out to her, but his voice caught in his throat.The woman reached out a hand towards him, her expression pleading, before vanishing into thin air. John sat there, frozen in shock, unsure if what he had just witnessed was real or a trick of his tired mind.When Mary finally arrived home, John recounted the strange encounter to her. Mary, always the practical one, attributed it to stress and fatigue, trying to reassure her husband that it was just a figment of his imagination. But deep down, she couldn't shake off the lingering sense of foreboding that had settled over their home.Days passed, and the haunting presence in the apartment only intensified. Doors creaked open on their own, whispers echoed in the empty rooms, and an oppressive feeling of dread hung in the air. Mary's skepticism began to waver as she, too, caught glimpses of the mysterious woman with sorrowful eyes.One stormy evening, a frantic knock on their door shattered the silence. A woman stood on their doorstep, bloodied and injured, her eyes wide with fear. She collapsed into their arms, gasping for breath, and pointed a trembling finger towards an empty space before her.
