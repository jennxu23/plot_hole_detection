Professor Augustus S. F. X. Van Dusen, also known as The Thinking Machine, sat in his study, surrounded by books and scientific apparatus. His bald head gleamed under the lamplight as he pored over the details of the case of Baby Blake, a mystery that had perplexed the entire town.Hatch, his loyal assistant, stood nearby, holding a stack of papers containing witness statements and evidence collected from the Blake home. The distraught parents had sought the help of The Thinking Machine after their baby had gone missing without a trace."The key to solving this mystery lies in the smallest details, Hatch," Professor Van Dusen remarked, his sharp eyes scanning the documents in front of him.Hatch nodded in agreement, knowing that his mentor's keen deductive skills would unravel the enigma surrounding Baby Blake's disappearance.After hours of meticulous examination and analysis, The Thinking Machine suddenly exclaimed, "Hatch, we must visit the Blake home immediately. There is something there that requires my personal inspection."Without delay, the duo made their way to the Blake residence, where they were met by the anxious parents. The mother clutched a photograph of her missing baby, tears glistening in her eyes.As Professor Van Dusen surveyed the house, his gaze fell upon a peculiar sightâ€”a set of small, muddy footprints leading from the backyard to the open window of the nursery."Hatch, take note of these footprints," the Professor instructed. "They may hold the key to unlocking this mystery."Upon closer examination, the footprints appeared to be smaller than that of a human's, leading The Thinking Machine to a startling conclusion.
