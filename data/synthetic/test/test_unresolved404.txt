It was a dreary day when Kennedy and Walter were called to Fletcherwood, the grand estate of the late steel magnate, John G. Fletcher. The news of his sudden death had sent shockwaves through the community, and the mysterious circumstances surrounding it only added to the intrigue. As Kennedy and Walter arrived at the estate, they were met by Professor Fletcher, the nephew of the deceased, who was visibly distraught."I'm glad you're here, Kennedy," Professor Fletcher said, his voice filled with emotion. "There's something strange about my uncle's death. The safe in his library was found opened, and his will is missing. I can't shake the feeling that something sinister is at play here."Kennedy nodded thoughtfully, his keen eyes taking in the somber atmosphere of the estate. "Let's start by examining the safe and the scene of the crime," he suggested. "There may be clues that will shed light on what really happened."As they entered the library, Kennedy's sharp gaze fell upon the opened safe. He noted the intricate drilling marks on the door and the missing will box. Walter, ever the diligent assistant, began to survey the room for any overlooked evidence.After a thorough examination, Kennedy turned to Professor Fletcher. "Do you know of anyone who may have had a motive to alter your uncle's will?" he inquired.The professor hesitated before mentioning Helen Bond, his second cousin and fianc√©e. "Helen stood to inherit a substantial amount from the will. She and Jack, her beloved, were always in need of money for their extravagant lifestyle," he explained.Kennedy's interest was piqued. He decided to delve deeper into Helen Bond's background and motivations. With Walter's help, they uncovered a web of deceit and greed that hinted at Helen's involvement in the disappearance of the will.
