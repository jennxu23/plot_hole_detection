It was a dark and stormy night as Abner approached the sinister house where the notorious hunchback Gaul resided. The wind howled mournfully, and the rain lashed against the windows, adding to the eerie atmosphere surrounding the decrepit building. Abner's heart pounded in his chest as he hesitated at the doorstep, the weight of his mission heavy on his shoulders.He had come to confront Gaul about the suspicious death of his beloved brother, Ezra. Abner was convinced that Gaul, with his twisted form and sinister reputation, had orchestrated the tragedy that had befallen his family. Determined to seek justice for his brother's untimely demise, Abner steeled himself and knocked on the door.To his surprise, Gaul answered almost immediately, his hunched figure looming in the dimly lit doorway. Abner's eyes flickered to the child standing behind Gaul, a young girl with wide, frightened eyes. Gaul's voice was gravelly as he asked Abner inside, his piercing gaze locking onto Abner's with a mix of curiosity and suspicion.As Abner entered the house, he could feel the oppressive presence of the past weighing down on him. The walls seemed to whisper secrets, and the air was heavy with tension. Abner wasted no time and cut straight to the chase, accusing Gaul of being responsible for Ezra's death.Gaul's denials were vehement, his voice rising in anger as he protested his innocence. But Abner remained resolute, pulling out a deed he had prepared that would implicate Gaul in the crime. With a steady hand, he pushed the document towards Gaul, demanding that he sign it, sealing his fate.The room fell silent as Gaul hesitated, his eyes flickering between the deed and Abner's unwavering gaze. The child watched on with a mixture of fear and fascination, her small form a stark contrast to the tension that crackled in the air.
