Dr. Halifax's unconventional treatment had been the key to her recovery, and she was grateful beyond words.Her family gathered around her, their faces full of relief and joy. Her mother's eyes brimmed with tears, her father's stern expression softened with pride, and her younger sister beamed with happiness. They had stood by her through the darkest days of her addiction, never giving up hope that she would find her way back to them.And then there was Captain Oliver, her steadfast fianc√©, who had never wavered in his support and love for her. His eyes met hers with a mixture of admiration and tenderness, and she felt her heart swell with gratitude for having him by her side."Frances, my dear," her mother said, her voice trembling with emotion, "we are so proud of you. You have shown such strength and courage in overcoming this challenge."Frances smiled, her eyes shining with tears of happiness. "I couldn't have done it without all of you," she said softly. "Your love and support have been my rock throughout this journey."Dr. Halifax, a tall and imposing figure with a kind face, entered the room with a smile. "I am so pleased to see you looking so well, Miss Wilton," he said. "You have come a long way since we first met."Frances nodded, her gratitude towards the doctor overflowing. "Thank you, Dr. Halifax. Your unconventional methods truly saved me."The doctor chuckled. "Sometimes, the most effective treatments are the ones that go against convention. I am just glad that we were able to find a solution that worked for you."As the morning turned into afternoon, Frances found herself surrounded by love and laughter. Her family and Captain Oliver regaled her with stories and jokes, and she felt the warmth of their presence enveloping her like a comforting blanket.But as the day wore on, a shadow of unease crept into Frances' heart. Despite the overwhelming joy of her recovery, a lingering doubt nagged at the back of her mind. What if this newfound freedom was too good to be true? What if her addiction came back to haunt her?
