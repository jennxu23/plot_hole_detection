It was a gloomy evening when Hewitt received a visit from Mr. Crellan, a middle-aged gentleman with a troubled expression on his face. Intrigued by questions of psychology and always ready for a challenge, Hewitt welcomed him into his modest office."Mr. Hewitt," began Crellan, "I come to you with a most perplexing problem. My late friend, Mr. Garth, entrusted me with his will before his untimely demise. However, since his passing, the will has mysteriously disappeared. I suspect foul play, and I implore you to help me uncover the truth."Hewitt's curiosity was piqued. The prospect of solving a mystery involving manipulation and deceit was irresistible to his keen mind. He agreed to take on the case and immediately set to work investigating the disappearance of the will.As Hewitt delved into the details of the case, he discovered that Mr. Mellis, a close associate of Mr. Garth, had been acting suspiciously in the days leading up to the disappearance. Mellis, a charming and charismatic man, had a reputation for being quite persuasive in his dealings with others.
