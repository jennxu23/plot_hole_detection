WAS it a specter?For days I could not answer this question. I am no believer in spiritualmanifestations, yet--But let me tell my story.I was lodging with my wife on the first floor of a house inTwenty-seventh street. I had taken the apartments for three months,and we had already lived in them two and found them sufficientlycomfortable. The back room we used as a bedroom, and while itcommunicated with the hall, we invariably made use of the frontparlor-door to go in and out of. Two great leaves of old mahoganyconnected the two rooms, and as we received but few friends, these doorsusually stood half open.One morning, my wife being ill, I left her lying in bed and stepped intothe parlor preparatory to going out for breakfast. It was late--nineo'clock, probably--and I was hastening to leave, when I heard a soundbehind me--or did I merely feel a presence?--and, turning, saw a strangeand totally unknown woman coming toward me from my wife's room.As I had just left that room, and as there was no way of getting into itexcept through a door we always kept locked, I was so overpowered by myastonishment that I never thought of speaking or moving until she hadpassed me. Then I found voice, and calling out "Madam!" endeavored tostop her.But the madam, if madam she was, passed on as quietly, as mechanicallyeven, as if I had not raised my voice, and, before I could grasp thefact that she was melting from before me, flitted through the hall tothe front door and so out, leaving behind on the palm of my hand the"feel" of her wool dress, which I had just managed to touch.Not understanding her or myself or the strange thrill awakened bythis contact, I tore open the front door and looked out, expecting, ofcourse, to see her on the steps or on the sidewalk in front. But therewas no one of her appearance visible, and I came back questioningwhether I was the victim of a hallucination or just an everyday fool.To satisfy myself on this important question I looked about for thehall-boy, with the intention of asking him if he had seen any suchperson go out, but that young and inconsequent scamp was missing fromhis post as usual, and there was no one within sight to appeal to.There was nothing to do but to re-enter my rooms, where my attentionwas immediately arrested by the sight of my wife sitting up in bed andsurveying me with a look of unmistakable astonishment."Who was that woman?" she asked. "And how came she in here?"So she had seen her too."What woman, Lydia? I have not let in any woman. Did you think there wasa woman in this room?""Not in that room," she answered hoarsely, "but in this one. I saw herjust now passing through the folding doors. Wilbur, I am frightened. Seehow my hands shake. Do you think I am sick enough to imagine things?"I knew she was not, but I did not say so. I thought it would be betterfor her to think herself under some such delusion."You were dozing," said I. "If you had seen a woman here, you could tellme how she looked.""And I can," my wife broke in excitedly. "She was like the ghosts weread of, only that her dress and the veil or drapery she wore were allgray. Didn't you see her? You must have seen her. She went right byyou--a gray woman, all gray; a lady, Wilbur, and slightly lame. Could Ihave dreamed all that?""You must have!" I cried, shaking the one door communicating with thehall, so she might see it was locked, and even showing her the key ofit, lying in its accustomed place behind the bureau cushion. Yet Iwas in no satisfied condition myself, for she had described with thegreatest accuracy the very person I had myself seen. Had we been alikethe victims of a spiritual manifestation?This was Tuesday. On Friday my question seemed to receive an answer. Ihad been down town, as usual, and on returning found a crowd assembledin front of my lodging-house. A woman had been run over and was beingcarried into our rooms. In the glimpse I caught of her I saw that shewas middle-aged and was wrapped in a long black cloak. Later, this cloakfell off, as her hat had done long before, and I perceived that herdress was black and decent.She was laid on our bed and every attention paid her. But she had beengrievously injured about the head and gradually but surely sank beforeour eyes. Suddenly she roused and gave a look about her. It was aremarkable one--a look of recognition and almost of delight. Then sheraised one hand and, pointing with a significant gesture into the emptyspace before her, sank back and died.It was a sudden ending, and, anxious to see its effect upon my wife, whowas standing on the other side of the bed, I glanced her way with somemisgiving. She showed more feeling than I had anticipated. Indeed hercountenance was a study, and when, under, the influence of my scrutinyshe glanced my way, I saw that something of deeper import than thisunexpected death in our rooms lay at the bottom of her uneasy look.What that was, I was soon to know, for catching up from amid the foldsof the woman's gray-lined cloak a long gray veil which had fallen atthe bedside, she disposed it softly about the woman's face, darting me alook full of significance."You remember the vision I had the morning when I was sick?" shewhispered softly in my ear.I nodded, secretly thrilled to my very heart's core."Well, it was a vision of this woman. If she were living and on herfeet and wrapped, as I have shown you, in this veil, you would beholda living picture of the person I saw passing out of this room thatmorning.""I shall not dispute you," I answered. Alas, I had myself perceived thelikeness the minute the veil had fallen about the pinched but handsomefeatures!"A forewarning," whispered my wife, "a forewarning of what has this dayhappened under our roof. It was a wraith we saw. Wilbur, I shall notspend another night in these rooms."And we did not. I was as anxious to leave as she was. Yet I am nota superstitious man. As proof of it, after the first effect of theseevents had left me, I began to question my first impressions and feeltolerably ashamed of my past credulity. Though the phenomenon wehad observed could not to all appearance be explained by any naturalhypothesis; though I had seen, and my wife had seen, a strange womansuddenly become visible in a room which a moment before had held no onebut ourselves, and into which no live woman could have entered withoutour knowledge, something--was it my natural good sense?--recoiled beforea supernatural explanation of this, and I found myself forced to believethat our first visitor had been as real as the last; in other words, thesame woman.But could I prove it? Could the seemingly impossible be made possibleand the unexplainable receive a solution satisfying to a rational mind?I determined to make an effort to accomplish this, if only to relievethe mind of my wife, who had not recovered her equanimity as readily asmyself.Starting with the assumption above mentioned--that the woman whohad died in our presence was the same who had previously found anunexplainable entrance into these same rooms--I first inquired if theblack cloak lined with gray did not offer a solution to some of myprevious difficulties. It was a long cloak, enveloping her completely.When worn with the black side out, she would present an inconspicuousappearance, but with the gray side out and the effect of this heightenedby a long gray veil flung over her hat, she would look like the graylady I had first seen. Now, a cloak can be turned in an instant, and ifshe had chosen to do this in flitting through my door I would naturallyfind only a sedate, black-clothed woman passing up the street, when,rousing from the apathy into which her appearance had thrown me, Irushed to the front door and looked out. Had I seen such a woman? Iseemed to remember that I had. Thus much, then, was satisfactory, but toaccount for her entrance into our rooms was not so easy. Had she slippedby me in coming in as she had on going out? The parlor door was open,for I had been out to get the paper. Could she have glided in by meunperceived and thus have found her way into the bedroom from which Iafterward saw her issue? No, for I had stood facing the front hall doorall the time. Through the bedroom door then? But that was, as I havesaid, locked. Here was a mystery, then; but it was one worth solving.My first step was to recall all that I had heard of the actual woman whohad been buried from our rooms. Her name, as ascertained in the cheapboarding-house to which she was traced, was Helmuth, and she was, so faras any one knew, without friends or relatives in the city. To those whosaw her daily she was a harmless, slightly demented woman with moneyenough to live above want, but not enough to warrant her boasting talkabout the rich things she was going to buy some day and the beautifulpresents she would soon be in a position to give away. The money foundon her person was sufficient to bury her, but no papers were in herpossession, nor any letters calculated to throw light upon her pastlife.Her lameness had been caused by paralysis, but the date of her attackwas not known.Finding no clue in this to what I wished to learn, I went back to ourold rooms, which had not been let since our departure, and soughtfor one there, and, strangely enough, I found it. I thought I kneweverything there was to be known about the apartment we had lived intwo months, but one little fact had escaped me which, under the scrutinythat I now gave it, became apparent. This was simply that the key whichopened the hall door of the bedroom and which we had seldom if ever usedwas not as old a key as that of the corresponding door in the parlor,and this fact, small as it was, led me to make inquiries.The result was that I learned something about the couple who hadpreceded us in the use of these rooms. They were of middle age and ofgreat personal elegance, but uncertain pay, the husband being nothingmore nor less than a professional gambler. Their name was L'Hommedieu.When I first heard of them, I thought that Mrs. L'Hommedieu might be theMrs. Helmuth in whose history I was so interested, but from all I couldlearn she was a very different sort of person. Mrs. L'Hommedieu was gay,dashing and capable of making a show out of a flimsy silk a shop-girlwould hesitate to wear. Yet she looked distinguished and wore hercheap jewelry with more grace than many a woman her diamonds. I would,consequently, have dropped this inquiry if some one had not remarkedupon her having had a paralytic stroke after leaving the house. This,together with the fact that the key to the rear door, which I had foundreplaced by a new one, had been taken away by her and never returned,connected her so indubitably with my mysterious visitor that I resolvedto pursue my investigations into Mrs. L'Hommedieu's past.For this purpose I sought out a quaint little maiden-lady living on thetop floor, who, I was told, knew more about the L'Hommedieus than anyone in the building. Miss Winterburn, whose acquaintance I had failedto make while residing in the house, was a fluttering, eager, affableperson, whose one delight was, as I soon found, to talk about theL'Homme-dieus. Of the story she related I give as much as I can of it inher own words."I was never their equal," said she, "but Mrs. L'Hommedieu was lonely,and, having no friends in town, was good enough to admit me to herparlor now and then and even to allow me to accompany her to the theaterwhen her husband was away on one of his mysterious visits. I never likedMr. L'Homme-dieu, but I did like her. She was so different from me, and,when I first knew her, so gay and so full of conversation. But afterawhile she changed and was either feverishly cheerful or morbidly sad,so that my visits caused me more pain than pleasure. The reason forthese changes in her was patent to everybody. Though her husband was ahandsome man, he was as unprincipled as he was unfortunate. He gambled.This she once admitted to me, and while at long intervals he met withsome luck he more often returned dispirited and with that hungry,ravening look you expect to see in a wolf cheated of its prey."I used to be afraid he would strike her after some one of thesedisappointments, but I do not think he ever did. She had a determinedcharacter of her own, and there have been times when I have thought hewas as much afraid of her as she was of him. I became sure of thisafter one night. Mrs. L'Hommedieu and myself were having a little suppertogether in the front parlor you have so lately occupied. It was avery ordinary supper, for the L'Hommedieus' purse had run low, and Mrs.L'Hommedieu was not the woman to spend much at any time on her eating.It was palatable, however, and had been cooked by us both together, andI was enjoying it and would have enjoyed it more if Mrs. L'Hommedieu hadhad more appetite. But she ate scarcely anything and seemed very anxiousand unhappy, though she laughed now and then with sudden gusts of mirthtoo hysterical to be real. It was not late, and yet we were both verymuch surprised when there came a knock at the door, followed by theentrance of a visitor."Mrs. L'Hommedieu, who is always _la grande dame_, rose without apparentembarrassment to meet the gentleman who entered, though I knew she couldnot help but feel keenly the niggardly appearance of the board she leftwith such grace. The stranger--he was certainly a stranger; this I couldsee by the formality of her manner--was a gentleman of urbane bearingand a general air of prosperity."I remember every word that passed."'My name is Lafarge,' said he. 'I am, or rather have been, under greatobligations to your husband, and I have come to discharge my debt. Is heat home?'"Mrs. L'Hommedieu's eye, which had sparkled at his name, droppedsuddenly as he put the final question."'I am sorry,' she returned after a moment of embarrassment, 'but myhusband is very seldom home evenings. If you could come about noon someday'--"'Thank you,' said he, with a bright smile, 'but I will finish mybusiness now and with you, seeing that Mr. L'Hommedieu is not at home.Years ago--I am sure you have heard your husband mention my name--Iborrowed quite a sum of money from him, which I have never paid. Yourecall the amount, no doubt?'"'I have heard Mr. L'Hommedieu say it was a thousand dollars,' shereplied, with a sudden fluttering of her hands indicative of greatexcitement."'That is the sum,' he allowed, either not noticing me or thinking metoo insignificant to be considered. 'I regret to have kept him so longout of it, but I have not forgotten to add the interest in making outthis statement of my indebtedness, and if you will look over this paperand acknowledge its correctness I will leave the equivalent of my debthere and now, for I sail for Europe to-morrow morning and wish to haveall my affairs in order before leaving.'"Mrs. L'Hommedieu, who looked ready to faint from excess of feeling,summoned up her whole strength, looking so beautiful as she did so, thatone forgot the ribbons on her sleeves were no longer fresh and that thesilk dress she wore hung in the very limpest of folds."'I am obliged to you,' she said in a tone from which she strove in vainto suppress all eagerness. 'And if I may speak for Mr. L'Hommedieu hewill be as grateful for your remembrance of us as for the money you sokindly offer to return to him.'"The stranger bowed low and took out a folded paper, which he handedher. He was not deceived, I am sure, by her grand airs, and knew as wellas I did that no woman ever stood in greater need of money. But nothingin his manner betrayed this knowledge."'It is a bond I give you,' he now explained. 'As you will see, it hascoupons attached to it, which you can cash at any time. It will prove asvaluable to you as so much ready money and possibly more convenient.'"And with just this hint, which I took as significant of his completeunderstanding of her position, he took her receipt and politely left thehouse."Once alone with me who am nobody, her joy had full vent. I have neverseen any one so lost in delight as she was for a few minutes. To havethis money thrust upon her just at a moment when actual want seemedstaring her in the face was too much of a relief for her to concealeither the misery she had been under or the satisfaction she nowenjoyed. Under the gush of her emotions her whole history came out, butas you have often heard the like I will not repeat it, especially as itwas all contained in the cry with which a little later she thrust thebond toward me."'He must not see it! He must not! It would go like all the rest, and Iwould again be left without a cent. Take it and keep it, for I have nomeans of concealing it here. He is too suspicious.'"But this was asking more than I was willing to grant. Seeing how Ifelt, she thrust the paper into her bosom with a look before whichI secretly recoiled. 'You will not charge yourself with such aresponsibility?' said she. 'But I can trust you not to tell him?'"'Yes,' I nodded, feeling sick of the whole business."'Then'--But here the door was violently flung open and without anywarning Mr. L'Hommedieu burst into the room in a state of as muchexcitement as his wife, only his was the excitement of desperation."'Gone! Gone!' he cried, ignoring me as completely as had Mr. Lafarge.'Not a dollar left; not even my studs! See!' And he pointed to hisshirt front hanging apart in a way I would never have looked for in thisreckless but fastidious gentleman. 'Yet if I had had a dollar more oreven a ring worth a dollar or so I might have---- Theresa, have you anymoney at all? A coin now might save us.'"Mrs. L'Hommedieu, who had turned alarmingly pale, drew up her finefigure and resolutely confronted him. 'No!' said she, and shifting hergaze she turned it meaningly upon me."He misunderstood this movement. Thinking it simply a reminder of mypresence, he turned and, with his false but impressive show of courtesy,made me a low bow. Then he forgot me utterly again, and facing his wife,growled out:"'Where are you going to get breakfast then? You don't look like a womanwho expects to starve!'"It was a fatal remark, for, do what she would, she could not prevent aslight smile of disdain, and, seeing it, he kept his eyes riveted on herface till her uneasiness became manifest. Instantly his suspicion tookform, and, surveying her still more fixedly, he espied a corner of theprecious paper protruding slightly above her corsage. To snatch itout, open it and realize its value was the work of a moment. Her cry ofdismay and his shout of mad triumph rang out simultaneously, and neverhave I seen such an ebullition of opposing passions as I was madewitness to as his hand closed over this small fortune and their staringeyes met in the mortal struggle they had now entered upon for itsultimate possession."She was the first to speak. 'It was given to me; it was meant for me.If I keep it, both of us will profit by it, but if you----'"He did not wait for her to finish. 'Where did you get it?' he cried.'I can break the bank with what I can raise on this bond at the club.Darraugh's in town. You know what that means. Luck's in the air, andwith an hundred dollars--But I've no time to talk. I came for a dollar,a fifty-cent piece, a dime even, and I go back with a bond worth----'"But she was already between him and the door. 'You will never carrythat bond out of this house,' she whispered in the tone which goesfurther than any cry. 'I have not held it in my hand to see it followevery other good thing I have had in life. I will not, Henry. Take thatbond and sink it as you have all the rest and I fall at your feet a deadwoman. I will never survive the destruction of my last hope.'"He was cowed--for a moment, that is; she looked so superb and sodetermined. Then all that was mean and despicable in his thinly veneerednature came to the surface, and, springing forward with an oath, he wasabout to push her aside, when, without the moving of a finger on herpart, he reeled back, recovered himself, caught at a chair, missed itand fell heavily to the floor."'My God, I thank thee!' was the exclamation with which she brokefrom the trance of terror into which she had been thrown by his suddenattempt to pass her; and without a glance at his face, which to melooked like the face of a dead man, she tore the paper from his hand andstood looking about her with a wild and searching gaze, in the desperatehope that somehow the walls would open and offer her a safe place ofconcealment for the precious sheet of paper. Meanwhile I had crept nearthe prostrate man. He was breathing, but was perfectly unconscious."'Don't you mean to do something for him?' I asked. 'He may die.'"She met my question with the dazed air of one suddenly awakened. 'No,he'll not die, but he'll not come to for some minutes, and this must behidden first. But where? where? I cannot trust it on my person or in anyplace a man like him would search. I must devise some means--ah!'"With this final exclamation she had dashed into the other room. I didnot see where she went--I did not want to--but I soon realized she wasworking somewhere in a desperate hurry. I could hear her breath comingin quick, short pants as I bent over her husband, waiting for him torouse and hating my inaction even while I succumbed to it."Suddenly she was back in the parlor again, and to my surprise passedimmediately to the little table in the corner where we had sat atsupper. We had had for our simple refreshment that homeliest of alldishes, boiled milk thickened with flour. There was still some left in abowl, and taking this away with her, she called back hoarsely:"'Pray that he does not come to till I have finished. It will be thebest prayer you ever made.'"She told me afterward that he was subject to these attacks and that shehad long ceased to be alarmed by them. But to me the sight of this manlying there so helpless, was horrible and, though I hated him and pitiedher, I scarcely knew what to wish. While battling with my desire to runand the feeling of loyalty which held me kneeling at that man's side, Iheard her speak again, this time in an even and slightly hard tone: 'Nowyou may dash a glass of cold water in his face. I am prepared to meethim. Happily his memory fails him after these attacks. I may succeed inmaking him believe that the bond he saw was one of his fancies.'"'Had you not better throw the water yourself?' I suggested, getting upand meeting her eye very quietly."She looked at me in wonder, then moved calmly to the table, took theglass and dashed a few drops of water into her husband's face. Instantlyhe began to stir, seeing which I arose without haste, but without anyunnecessary delay, and quietly took my leave. I could bear no more thatnight."Next morning I awoke in a fright. I had dreamed that he had come to myroom in search of the bond. But it was only her knock at the door andher voice, asking if she might enter at this early hour. It was such arelief I gladly let her in, and she entered with her best air and flungherself on my little lounge with the hysterical cry:"'He has sent me up. I told him I ought not to intrude at such aninconvenient hour: that you would not have had your breakfast.' (Howcarelessly she spoke! How hard she tried to keep the hungry note out ofher voice!) 'But he insisted upon my coming up. I know why. He searchedme before I left the room, and now he wants to search the room itself.'"'Then he did remember?' I began."'Yes, he remembers now. I saw it in his eyes as soon as he awoke. Buthe will not find the bond. That is safe, and some day when I shall haveescaped his vigilance long enough to get it back again I will use it soas to make him as well as myself comfortable. I am not a selfish woman.'"I did not think she was, and I felt pity for her, and so after dressingand making her a cup of tea--I can myself do very well without one ona pinch--I sat down with her, and we chatted for an hour or so quitecomfortably. Then she grew so restless and consulted the clock so oftenthat I tried to soothe her by remarking that it was not an easy task hehad set himself, at which she laughed in a mysterious way, but failed togrow less anxious till our suspense was cut short by the appearance ofthe janitor with a message from Mr. L'Hommedieu."'Mr. L'Hommedieu's compliments,' said he, 'and he hopes Mrs.L'Hommedieu will make herself comfortable and not think of coming down.He is doing everything that is necessary and will soon be through. Youcan rest quite easy, ma'am.'"'What does he mean?' marveled the poor woman as the janitordisappeared. 'Is he spending all this time ransacking the rooms? I wishI dared disobey him. I wish I dared go down.'"But her courage was not equal to an open disregard of his wishes, andshe had to subdue her impatience and wait for a summons that did notcome till near two o'clock. Then Mr. L'Hommedieu himself appeared withher hat and mantle on his arm."'My dear,' said he as she rose, haggard with excitement, to meet him,'I have brought your wraps with me that you may go directly from here toour new home. Shall I assist you to put them on? You do not look as wellas usual, and that is why I have undertaken this thing all myself--tosave you, my dear; to save you each and every exertion.'"I had flung out my arms to catch her, for I thought she was going tofaint, but she did not, though I think it would have been better for herif she had."'We are going to leave this house?' she asked, speaking very slowly andwith a studied lack of emotion that imposed upon nobody."'I have said so,' he smiled. 'The dray has already taken away the halfof our effects, and the rest will follow at Mrs. Latimer's convenience.'"'Ah, I understand!' she replied, with a gasp of relief significantof her fear that by some superhuman cunning he had found the bond shethought so safely concealed. 'I was wondering how Mrs. Latimer cameto allow us to leave.' (I tell you they always talked as if I were notpresent.) 'Our goods are left as a surety, it seems.'"'Half of our goods,' he blandly corrected. 'Would it interest you toknow which half?'"'The cunning of this insinuation was matched by the imperturbable shrugwith which she replied. 'So a bed has been allowed us and some clothesI am satisfied,' at which he bit his lips, vexed at her self-control andhis own failure to break it."'You have not asked where we are going,' he observed as with apparentsolicitude he threw her mantle over her shoulders."The air of lassitude with which she replied bespoke her feeling on thatpoint. 'I have little curiosity,' she said. 'You know I can be happyanywhere. And, turning toward me, she moved her lips in a way Iinterpreted to mean: 'Go below with me. See me out.'"'Say what you have to say to Miss Winter-burn aloud,' he drylysuggested."'I have nothing to say to Miss Winterburn but thanks,' was her coldreply, belied, however, by the trembling of her fingers as she essayedto fit on her gloves."'And those I will receive below!' I cried, with affected gaiety. 'I amgoing down with you to the door.' And resolutely ignoring his frown Itripped down before them. On the last stair I felt her steps lagging.Instantly I seemed to comprehend what was required of me, and, rushingforward, I entered the front parlor. He followed close behind me, forhow could he know I was not in collusion with her to regain the bond?This gave her one minute by herself in the rear, and in that minute shesecured the key which would give her future access to the spot where hertreasure lay hidden."The rest of the story I must give you mainly from hearsay. You mustunderstand by this time what Mr. L'Hommedieu's scheme was in movingthus suddenly. He knew that it would be impossible for him, by the mostminute and continuous watchfulness, to prevent his wife fromrecovering the bond while they continued to inhabit the rooms in which,notwithstanding his failure to find it, he had reason to believeit still lay concealed. But once in other quarters it would becomparatively easy for him to subject her to a surveillance whichnot only would prevent her from returning to this house without hisknowledge, but would lead her to give away her secret by the verynatural necessity she would be under of going to the exact spot whereher treasure lay hid."It was a cunning plot and showed him to be as able as he wasunscrupulous. How it worked I will now proceed to tell you. It musthave been the next afternoon that the janitor came running up to me--Isuppose he had learned by this time that I had more than ordinaryinterest in these people--to say that Mrs. L'Hommedieu had been in thehouse and had been so frightened by a man who had followed her that shehad fainted dead away on the floor. Would I go down to her?"I had rather have gone anywhere else, unless it was to prison, but dutycannot be shirked, and I followed the man down. But we were too late.Mrs. L'Hommedieu had recovered and gone away, and the person who hadfrightened her was also gone, and only the hall-boy remained to give anyexplanations."This was what he had to say:"'The man it was who went first. As soon as the lady fell he skippedout. I don't think he meant no good here--'"'Did she drop here in the hall?' I asked, unable to restrain my intenseanxiety."'Oh, no, ma'am! They was in the back room yonder, which she got insomehow. The man followed her in, sneaking and sneaking like an eel or acop, and she fell right against---'"'Don't tell me where!' I cried. 'I don't want to know where!' And I wasabout to return up-stairs when I heard a quick, sharp voice behindme and realized that Mr. L'Hommedieu had come in and was having somedispute with the janitor."Common prudence led me to listen. He wanted, as was very natural, toenter the room where his wife had just been surprised, but the janitor,alarmed by the foregoing very irregular proceedings, was disposed todeny his right to do so."'The furniture is held as a surety,' said he, 'and I have orders---'"But Mr. L'Hommedieu had a spare dollar, and before many minutes hadelapsed I heard him go into that room and close the door. Of the nextten minutes and the suspense I felt I need not speak. When he came outagain, he looked as if the ground would not hold him."'I have done some mischief, I fear,' he airily said as he passed bythe janitor. 'But I'll pay for it. Don't worry. I'll pay for it and therent, too, to-morrow. You may tell Mrs. Latimer so.' And he was gone,leaving us all agape in the hallway."A minute later we all crept to that room and looked in. Now that hehad got the money I for one was determined to know where she had hid it.There was no mistaking the spot. A single glance was enough to show usthe paper ripped off from a portion of the wall, revealing a narrow gapbehind the baseboard large enough to hold the bond. It was near--""Wait!" I put in as I remembered where the so called Mrs. Helmuthhad pointed just before she died. "Wasn't it at the left of the largefolding doors and midway to the wall?""How came you to know?" she asked. "Did Mrs. Latimer tell you?" But as Idid not answer she soon took up the thread of her narrative again, and,sighing softly, said:"The next day came and went, but no Mr. L'Hommedieu appeared; another,and I began to grow seriously uneasy; a third, and a dreadful thinghappened. Late in the afternoon Mrs. L'Hommedieu, dressed very oddly forher, came sliding in at the front door, and with an appealing smile atthe hall-boy, who wished but dared not ask her for the key which madethese visits possible, glided by to her old rooms, and, finding the doorunlocked, went softly in. Her appearance is worth description, for itshows the pitiful efforts she made at disguise, in the hope, I suppose,of escaping the surveillance she was evidently conscious of being under.She was in the habit of wearing on cool days a black circular witha gray lining. This she had turned inside out so that the gray wasuppermost, while over her neat black bonnet she had flung a long veil,also gray, which not only hid her face, but gave to her appearancean eccentric look as different as possible from her usual aspect. Thehall-boy, who had never seen her save in showy black or bright colors,said she looked like a ghost in the daytime, but it was all done fora purpose, I am sure, and to escape the attention of the man who hadbefore followed her. Alas, he might have followed her this time withoutaddition to her suffering! Scarcely had she entered the room where hertreasure had been left than she saw the torn paper and gaping baseboard,and, uttering a cry so piercing it found its way even to the stolidheart of the hall-boy, she tottered back into the hall, where she fellinto the arms of her husband, who had followed her in from the street ina state of frenzy almost equal to her own."The janitor, who that minute appeared on the stairway, says that henever saw two such faces. They looked at each other and were speechless.He was the first to hang his head."'It is gone, Henry,' she whispered. 'It is gone. You have taken it.'"He did not answer."'And it is lost! You have risked it, and it is lost!'"He uttered a groan. 'You should have given it to me that night. Therewas luck in the air then. Now the devil is in the cards and--'"Her arms went up with a shriek. 'My curse be upon you, HenryL'Hommedieu!'
