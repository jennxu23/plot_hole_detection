Dora sat in her cozy living room, sipping on a cup of tea while reading a novel, when a knock on the door interrupted her peaceful afternoon. Setting down her book, she went to answer it, finding the postman holding a telegram in his hand."Telegram for Miss Dora," the postman said, handing her the envelope.Curious, Dora opened the telegram and read the message inside.

She found him in his study, looking surprisingly composed considering the circumstances. When she questioned him about his wife's murder and Honor's arrest, he brushed off her concerns with a casual shrug.Unsatisfied with his response, Dora decided to delve deeper into the mystery. She followed Dr. Phillimore to an appointment with Madame Celestine, a renowned palmist known for her uncanny ability to reveal hidden truths.In Madame Celestine's dimly lit parlor, Dora watched as the palmist studied Dr. Phillimore's hand with a furrowed brow.
