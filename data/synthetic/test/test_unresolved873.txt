She introduced herself as Alice Dale and handed him a letter. As Mr. Beck read the contents, his curiosity was piqued. The letter detailed a murder that had shaken the village—the shooting of Squire Ackland, and the subsequent arrest of his nephew, Richard Ackland.Alice implored Mr. Beck to help prove Richard's innocence, believing him to be wrongly accused.
