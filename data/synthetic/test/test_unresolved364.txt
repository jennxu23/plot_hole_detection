Detective Kennedy sat in his cluttered office, the dim light casting shadows across his face as he poured over the evidence in the case of Georgette Gilbert's disappearance. Her distraught parents had come to him, desperate for answers, and Kennedy was determined to uncover the truth.As he sifted through the clues, a pattern began to emerge. Georgette had visited several fortune-tellers and practitioners of the occult sciences in the weeks leading up to her disappearance. Kennedy knew there was a connection, but he needed concrete evidence to tie it all together.One day, while examining the personal effects found in Georgette's possession, Kennedy made a startling discovery. Clenched tightly in her hand were several strands of hair, which he carefully preserved for analysis. He also sent samples of a mysterious drug found in her system for testing.
