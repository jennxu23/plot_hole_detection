It was a dark and stormy night at Chepstow Manor, where Lord and Lady Chepstow were hosting a lavish dinner party. Little Lord Chepstow, their young son and heir, played innocently in the nursery upstairs, unaware of the danger lurking in the shadows.Cleek, the renowned detective with his keen intellect and quick wits, had been invited to the party by Lady Chepstow herself. As the rain lashed against the windows, a sense of unease settled over the manor. Cleek, always alert to the slightest hint of trouble, noticed the tension in the air and the whispers of servants in the corridors.As Cleek mingled with the guests, he observed the enigmatic figure of Merode, a mysterious foreign guest who seemed to be taking a keen interest in little Lord Chepstow. Cleek's intuition told him that Merode was not to be trusted, and that danger was imminent.Suddenly, a scream pierced the air, echoing through the halls of Chepstow Manor. Cleek sprang into action, racing upstairs to the nursery where he found Ailsa, the young governess, cradling little Lord Chepstow in her arms. She was pale and shaken, but her eyes were filled with determination."Ailsa, what happened?" Cleek demanded, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of danger.
