It was a scorching hot afternoon in the rural countryside, the sun beating down mercilessly on the dusty roads and fields. Abner and Dillworth found themselves riding side by side, the only sound the rhythmic thud of their horses' hooves on the hard-packed earth. Abner, with his weather-beaten face and piercing eyes, exuded an air of quiet authority, while Dillworth, a wiry man with a nervous energy about him, seemed ill at ease in Abner's presence.As they rode, Abner's keen eye caught a glint of metal hidden among the rocks at the edge of the road. He reined in his horse abruptly, causing Dillworth to start in surprise."What's the matter, Abner?" Dillworth asked, his voice tinged with unease.Abner dismounted and walked over to the rocks, his eyes fixed on the object he had spotted. As he drew closer, he saw it was a gun, half-buried in the dirt, its barrel gleaming in the harsh sunlight. His heart sank as he realized the implications of this discovery.
