The small village of Oakwood was shrouded in grief following the tragic death of Letitia Woodriff. The Coroner's jury had concluded that her passing was an unfortunate accident caused by ingesting a lethal dose of poison meant for the family's dog. Mr. Woodriff, a once jovial and prosperous man, now bore the weight of sorrow on his shoulders, his eyes haunted by loss.It was in this somber atmosphere that a stranger arrived at the Woodriff residence. Paul Beck presented himself as Mr. Woodriff's long-lost brother, Peter. His arrival stirred whispers among the villagers, who found his sudden appearance rather suspicious. Mr. Woodriff, however, welcomed the stranger with open arms, desperate for any semblance of family in his time of need.As days passed, strange occurrences began to unfold in the Woodriff household. Milly, Mr. Woodriff's surviving daughter, fell ill with symptoms eerily similar to Letitia's before her tragic demise. Paul Beck, the supposed long-lost brother, grew increasingly vigilant, sensing a malevolent presence within the walls of the house.
