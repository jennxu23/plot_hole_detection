HER room was on the ground floor of the house we mutually inhabited,and mine directly above it, so that my opportunities for seeing her werelimited to short glimpses of her auburn head as she leaned out of thewindow to close her shutters at night or open them in the morning. Yetour chance encounter in the hall or on the walk in front, had made sodeep an impression upon my sensibilities that I was never without thevision of her pale face set off by the aureole of reddish brown hair,which, since my first meeting with her, had become for me the symbol ofeverything beautiful, incomprehensible and strange.For my fellow-lodger was a mystery.I am a busy man now, but just at the time of which I speak, I hadleisure in abundance.I was sharing with many others the unrest of the perilous dayssubsequent to the raid of John Brown at Harper's Ferry. Abraham Lincolnhad been elected President. Baltimore, where the incidents I am relatingtranspired, had become the headquarters of men who secretly leaguedthemselves in antagonism to the North. Men and women who felt that theirNorthern brethren had grievously wronged them planned to undermine thestability of the government. The schemes at this time were giganticin their conception and far-reaching in their scope and endlessramifications.Naturally under these conditions, a consciousness of ever-present dangerhaunted every thinking mind. The candor of the outspoken was regardedwith doubt, and the reticence of the more cautious, with distrust. Itwas a trying time for sensitive, impressionable natures with nothing todo. Perhaps all this may account for the persistency with which I satin my open window. I was thus sitting one night--a memorable one tome--when I heard a sharp exclamation from below, in a voice I had longlistened for.Any utterance from those lips would have attracted my attention; but,filled as this was with marked, if not extraordinary, emotion, Icould not fail to be roused to a corresponding degree of curiosity andinterest.Thrusting out my head, I cast a rapid glance downward. A shutterswinging in the wind, and the escaping figure of a man hurrying roundthe corner of the street, were all that rewarded my scrutiny; though,from the stream of light issuing from the casement beneath, I perceivedthat her window, like my own, was wide open.As I continued to watch this light, I saw her thrust out her head withan eagerness indicative of great excitement. Peering to right and left,she murmured some suppressed words mixed with gasps of such strongfeeling that I involuntarily called out:"Excuse me, madam, have you been frightened in any way by the man I sawrunning away from here a moment ago?"She gave a great start and glanced up. I see her face yet--beautiful,wonderful; so beautiful and so wonderful I have never been able toforget it. Meeting my eye, she faltered out:"Did you see a man running away from here? Oh, sir, if I might have aword with you!"I came near leaping directly to the pavement in my ardor and anxiety tooblige her, but, remembering before it was too late that she was neithera Juliet nor I a Romeo, I merely answered that I would be with her in amoment and betook myself below by the less direct but safer means of thestaircase.It was a short one and I was but a moment in descending, but that momentwas long enough for my heart to acquire a most uncomfortable throb,and it was with anything but an air of quiet self-possession that Iapproached the threshold I had never before dared to cross even infancy.The door was open and I caught one glimpse of her figure before she wasaware of my presence. She was contemplating her right hand with a lookof terror, which, added to her striking personality, made her seem atthe instant a creature of alarming characteristics fully as capable ofawakening awe as devotion.I may have given some token of the agitation her appearance awakened,for she turned towards me with sudden vehemence."Oh!" she cried, with a welcoming gesture; "you are the gentleman fromup-stairs who saw a man running away from here a moment ago. Would youknow that man if you saw him again?""I am afraid not," I replied. "He was only a flying figure in my eyes.""Oh!" she moaned, bringing her hands together in dismay. But,immediately straightening herself, she met my regard with one asdirect as my own. "I need a friend," she said, "and I am surrounded bystrangers."I made a move towards her; I did not feel myself a stranger. But how wasI to make her realize the fact?"If there is anything I can do," I suggested.Her steady regard became searching."I have noticed you before to-night," she declared, with a directnessdevoid of every vestige of coquetry. "You seem to have qualities thatmay be trusted. But the man capable of helping me needs the strongestmotives that influence humanity: courage, devotion, discretion, and atotal forgetfulness of self. Such qualifications cannot be looked for ina stranger."As if with these words she dismissed me from her thoughts, she turnedher back upon me. Then, as if recollecting the courtesy due even tostrangers, she cast me an apologetic glance over her shoulder andhurriedly added:"I am bewildered by my loss. Leave me to the torment of my thoughts. Youcan do nothing for me."Had there been the least evidence of falsity in her tone or theslightest striving after effect in her look or bearing, I would havetaken her at her word and left her then and there. But the candor ofthe woman and the reality of her emotion were not to be questioned, andmoved by an impulse as irresistible as it was foolhardy, I cried withthe impetuosity of my twenty-one years:"I am ready to risk my life for you. Why, I do not know and do not careto ask. I only know you could have found no other man so willing to doyour bidding."A smile, in which surprise was tempered by a feeling almost tender,crossed her lips and immediately vanished. She shook her head as if indeprecation of the passion my words evinced, and was about to dismissme, when she suddenly changed her mind and seized upon the aid I hadoffered, with a fervor that roused my sense of chivalry anddeepened what might have been but a passing fancy into an active andall-engrossing passion."I can read faces," said she, "and I have read yours. You will do for mewhat I cannot do for myself, but----Have you a mother living?"I answered no; that I was very nearly without relatives or ties."I am glad," she said, half to herself. Then with a last searching look,"Have you not even a sweetheart?"I must have reddened painfully, for she drew back with a hesitatingand troubled air; but the vigorous protest I hastened to make seemed toreassure her, for the next word she uttered was one of confidence."I have lost a ring." She spoke in a low but hurried tone. "It wassnatched from my finger as I reached out my hand to close my shutters.Some one must have been lying in wait; some one who knows my habitsand the hour at which I close my window for the night. The loss I havesustained is greater than you can conceive. It means more, much more,than appears. To the man who will bring me back that ring direct fromthe hand that stole it, I would devote the gratitude of a lifetime.Are you willing to make the endeavor? It is a task I cannot give to thepolice."This request, so different from any I had expected, checked myenthusiasm in proportion as it awoke a senseless jealousy."Yet it seems directly in their line," I suggested, seeing nothingbut humiliation before me if I attempted the recovery of a simplelove-token."I know that it must seem so to you," she admitted, reading my thoughtsand answering them with skilful indirectness. "But what policeman wouldundertake a difficult and minute search for an article whose intrinsicvalue would not reach five dollars?""Then it is only a memento," I stammered, with very evident feeling."Only a memento," she repeated; "but not of love. Worthless as it is initself, it would buy everything I possess, and almost my soul to-night.I can explain no further. Will you attempt its recovery?"Restored to myself by her frank admission that it was no lover'skeepsake I was urged to recapture and return, I allowed the powerfulindividuality of this woman to have its full effect upon me. Taking inwith one glance her beauty, the impassioned fervor of her nature, andthe subtle charm of a spirit she now allowed to work its full spell uponme, I threw every practical consideration to the winds, and impetuouslyreplied:"I will endeavor to regain this ring for you. Tell me where to go, andwhom to attack, and if human wit and strength can compass it, you shallhave the jewel back before morning."Oh!" she protested, "I see that you anticipate a task of smalldifficulty. You cannot recover this particular ring so easily as that.In the first place, I do not in the least know who took it; I only knowits destination. Alas! if it is allowed to reach that destination, I ambereft of hope.""No love token," I murmured, "and yet your whole peace depends on itsrecovery.""More than my peace," she answered; and with a quick movement she closedthe door which I had left open behind me. As its sharp bang rangthrough the room, I realized into what a pitfall I had stumbled. Only apolitical intrigue of the most desperate character could account for thewords I had heard and the actions to which I had been a witness. But Iwas in no mood to recoil even from such dangers as these, and so my lookshowed her as she leaned toward me with the words:"Listen! I am burdened with a secret. I am in this house, in this city,for a purpose. The secret is not my own and I cannot part with it;neither is my purpose communicable. You therefore will be obliged todeal with the greatest dangers blindfold. One encouragement only I cangive you. You will work for good ends. You are pitted against wrong, notright, and if you succumb, it will be in a cause you yourself would callnoble. Do I make myself understood, Mr.--Mr. ------""Abbott," I put in, with a bow.She took the bow for an affirmative, as indeed I meant she should. "Youdo not recoil," she murmured, "not even when I say that you must takeno third party into your confidence, no matter to what extremity you arebrought.""I would not be the man I think I am, if I recoiled," I said, smiling.She waved her hand with almost a stern air."Swear!" she commanded; "swear that, from the moment you leave thisdoor till you return to it, you will breathe no word concerning me, yourerrand, or even the oath I am now exacting from you.""Ah!" thought I to myself, "this is serious." But I took the oath underthe spell of the most forceful personality I had ever met, and did notregret it--_then_."Now let us waste no more time," said she."In the large building on ------ Street there is an office with the nameof Dr. Merriam on the door. See! I have written it on this card, so thatthere may be no mistake about it. That office is open to patients fromten in the morning until twelve at noon. During these hours any one canenter there; but to awaken no distrust, he should have some ailment.Have you not some slight disorder concerning which you might consult aphysician?""I doubt it," said I; "but I might manufacture one.""That would not do with Dr. Merriam. He is a skilful man; he would seethrough any imposture.""I have a sick friend," I ruminated. "And by the way, his case isobscure and curious. I could interest any doctor in it in five minutes.""That is good; consult him in regard to your friend; meantime--while youare waiting for the interview, I mean--take notice of a large box youwill find placed on a side-table. Do not seem to fix your attention onit, but never let it be really out of your sight from the moment thedoor is unlocked at ten till you are forced by the doctor's importunityto leave the room at twelve. If you are alone there for one minute(and you will be allowed to remain there alone if you show no haste toconsult the doctor) unlock that box--here is the key--and look carefullyinside. No one will interfere and no one will criticize you; there ismore than one person who has access to that box.""But--" I put in."You will discover there," she whispered, "a hand of bronze lying onan enamelled cushion. On the fingers of this hand there should be, anddoubtless are, rings of forged steel of peculiar workmanship. _If thereis one on the middle finger_, my cause is lost, and I can only await theend." Her cheek paled. "_But if there is not_, you may be sure that anattempt will be made by some one to-morrow--I do not know whom--to putone there before the office closes at noon. The ring will be mine--theone stolen from my hand just now--and it will be your business toprevent the box being opened for this purpose, by any means short ofpublic interference involving arrest and investigation; for this, too,would be fatal. The delay of a day may be of incalculable service to me.It would give me time to think, if not to act. Does the undertaking seema hopeless one? Am I asking too much of your inexperience?""It does not seem a hopeful one," I admitted; "but I am willing toundertake the adventure. What are its dangers? And why, if I see thering on the finger you speak of, cannot I take it off and bring it backto you?""Because," said she, answering the last question first, "the ringbecomes a part of the mechanism the moment it is thrust over the lastjoint. You could not draw it off. As for the dangers I allude to, theyare of a hidden character, and part of the secret I mentioned. If,however, you exercise your wit, your courage, and a proper amount ofstrategy, you may escape. Interference must be _proved_ against you.That rule, at least, has been held inviolate."Aghast at the mysterious perils she thus indicated in the path towardwhich she was urging me, I for one instant felt an impulse to retreat.But adventure of any kind has its allurements for an unoccupied youthof twenty-one, and when seasoned, as this was, by a romantic, ifunreasonable, passion, proved altogether too irresistible for me to giveit up. Laughing outright in my endeavor to throw off the surplus of myexcitement, I drew myself up and uttered some fiery phrase of courage,which I doubt if she even heard. Then I said some word about the doctor,which she at once caught up."The doctor," said she, "may know, and may not know, the mysteries ofthat box. I would advise you to treat him solely as a doctor. He whouses the key you now hold in your hand cannot be too wary; by which Imean too careful or too silent. Oh, that I dared to go there myself! Butmy agitation would betray me. Besides, my person is known, or this ringwould never have been taken from me."I will be your deputy," I assured her. "Have you any furtherinstructions?""No," said she; "instructions are useless in an affair of this kind.Your actions must be determined by the exigencies of the moment.Meantime, my every thought will be yours. Good-night, sir; pray God, itmay not be good-by.""One moment," I said, as I arose to go. "Have you any objection totelling me your name?""I am Miss Calhoun," she said, with a graceful bow.This was the beginning of my formidable adventure with the bronze hand.THE building mentioned by my new-found friend was well known to me. Itwas one of the kind in which every other office is unoccupied the yearround. Such tenants as gave it the little air of usefulness it possessedwere of the bad-pay kind. They gave little concern to their own affairsand less to those of their neighbors. The public avoided the building,and the tenants did nothing to encourage a change. In a populous city,on the corner made by frequented streets, it stood as much alone andneglected as if it were a ruin. Old or young eyes may have lookedthrough its begrimed windows into the busy thoroughfare beneath, butnone in the street ever honored the old place with a glance or thought.No one even wasted contempt upon its smoky walls, and few disturbed theaccumulated dust upon the stairs or in the dimly-lighted hallways.Had a place been sought for wherein the utmost secrecy might beobserved, surely this was that place. As I neared the door upon which Iread the doctor's name, I found myself treading on tip-toe, so impressedhad I become by a sense of caution, if not of dread.I had made every effort to be on hand at precisely ten o'clock, and feltso sure that I had been the first to arrive that I reached out to thedoor-knob with every expectation of entering, unseen by any one, andpossibly unheard. To my dismay, the first twist I gave it resulted in arusty shriek that set my teeth on edge, and echoed down the gloomy hall.With my flesh creeping, I opened the door and passed into the doctor'souter room.It was far from being empty. Seated in chairs ranged along two sides ofthe room, I saw a dozen or more persons, male and female. All wore thepreoccupied air that patients are apt to assume while awaiting theirturn to be called by the doctor. One amongst the number made an effortat indifference by drawing out and pushing back a nail in the flooringwith the sole of her pretty shoe. It may have been intended forcoquetry, and at another time might have bewitched me; now it seemedstrangely out of place. The man who was to all appearance counting theflies in the web of an industrious spider was more in keeping with theplace, my feelings, and the atmosphere of despondency that the room gaveout.As I had no doubt that the ring I was seeking was in the possession ofsome one of these persons, I gave each as minute an examination as waspossible under the circumstances. Only two amongst them appeared open tosuspicion. Of these, one was a young man whose naturally fine featureswould have prepossessed him in my favor had it not been for the peculiaralertness of his bright blue eye, which flashed incessantly in everydirection till each and all of us seemed to partake of his restlessnessand anxiety. Why was he not depressed? The other was the girl, or,rather, the young lady to whose pretty foot I have referred. If she wasat all conspicuous, it was owing to the contrast between her beautifulface and the Quaker-like simplicity of her dress. She was restless also;her foot had ceased its action, but her hand moved constantly. Nowit clutched its fellow in her lap, and now it ran in an oft-repeatedaction, seemingly beyond her control, up and down and round and round aplain but expensive leather bag she wore at her side. "She carries thering," thought I, sitting down in the chair next her.Meantime, I had not been oblivious of _the box_. It stood upon a plainoak table directly opposite the door by which I had come in. Itwas about a foot square, and was the only object in the room at allornamental. Indeed, there was but little else for the eye to rest on,consequently most of us looked that way, though I noticed that but fewseemed to take any real interest in that or anything else within sight.This was encouraging, and I was on the point of transferring my entireattention to the two persons I have named, when one of them, thenearest, rose hurriedly and went out.This was an unexpected move on her part, and I did not know what to makeof it. Had I annoyed her by my scrutiny, or had she divined my errand?In my doubt, I consulted the face of the man I secretly thought to beher accomplice. It was non-committal, and, in my doubt as to the meaningof all this, I allowed myself to become interested in a pale young womanwho had been sitting on the other side of the lady who had just left.She was evidently a patient who stood in great need of assistance. Herhead hung feebly forward, and her whole figure looked ready to drop. Yetwhen a minute later the door of the inner office opened, and the doctorappeared on the sill in an expectant attitude, she made no attempt torise, but pushed forward another woman who seemed less indisposed thanherself. I had to compel myself to think of all I saw as being real andwithin my experience.Surprised by this action on the part of one so ill, I watched the palegirl for an instant, and almost forgot my mission in the compassionaroused by her sickly appearance. But soon that mission and my motivefor being in this place were somewhat vividly recalled to me by anunexpected action on this very young woman's part. With the suddenmovement of an acutely suffering person, she bounded from her seat andcrossed the floor to where the box stood, gasping for breath, and almostfalling against the table when she reached it.A grunt from the good-looking young man followed; but neither he northe middle-aged female with a pitiful skin disease, who had been sittingnear her, offered to go to her assistance, though the latter looked asif she would like to. I was the only one to rise. The truth is, Icould see no one touch _the box_ without having something more than mycuriosity awakened. Approaching her respectfully, and with as complete adissimulation of my real feelings as possible, I ventured to say:"You are very ill, miss. Shall I summon the doctor?"She was clutching the side of the table for support, and her head,drooping helplessly over the box, was swaying from side to side as sherocked to and fro in her pain."Thank you!" she gasped, without turning, "I will wait. I would ratherwait."At that moment the doctor's door opened again."There he is now," said I."I will wait," she insisted. "Let the others take their turn."Satisfied now that something besides pain caused her interest in thebox, I drew back, asking myself whether she had been in possession ofthe ring from the beginning, or whether it had been passed to her by herrestless neighbor. Meanwhile, another patient had disappeared into theadjoining room.A few minutes passed. The man with the restless eye began to fidget.Could it be that she was simply guarding the box, and that he was theone who wished to open it? As the doubt struck me, I surveyed hermore attentively. She was certainly doing something besides supportingherself with that sly right hand of hers. Yes, that was a click I heard.She was fitting a key into the lock. Startled, but determined notto betray myself, I assumed an air of great patience, and, taking amemorandum book from my pocket, began to write in it. Meantime, thedoctor had disposed of his second patient and had beckoned to a third.To my astonishment, my friend with the nervous manner responded, thusacquitting himself in my eyes from any interest in the box.The interview he had with the doctor lasted some time; meantime, theyoung woman in the window remained more or less motionless. When thefourth person left the room, she turned and cast a quick glance atmyself and the other person present.I knew what it meant. She was anxious to be left alone in order to liftthat mysterious lid. She was no more ill than I was.There was even a dash of color in her cheeks, and the trembling sheindulged in was caused by great excitement and suspense, and not bypain.Compassion at once gave way to anger, and I inwardly resolved not tospare her if we came into conflict over the box.My companion was an old and non-observant man, who had come in after therest of us. When the doctor again appeared, I motioned to this old manto follow him, which he very gladly did, leaving me alone with the palegirl. At once I got up, showing my fatigue and slightly yawning."This is very tedious," I muttered aloud, and stepped idly towards thedoor leading into the hall.The girl at the box could not restrain her impatience. She cast meanother short glance. I affected not to see it; took out my watch,consulted it, put it back quickly and slipped out into the hall. As Iclosed the door behind me, I heard a slight creak. Instantly I was backagain, and with so sudden a movement that I surprised her, with her facebent over the open box."Oh, my poor young lady," I exclaimed, springing towards her with everyappearance of great concern. "You do not look able to stand. Lean on meif you feel faint, and I will help you to a seat."She turned upon me in a fury, but, meeting my eye, assumed an air ofcomposure, which did not impose upon me in the least, or prevent me frompressing close to her side and taking one look into the box, which shehad evidently not had sufficient self-possession to close.The sight which met my eye was not unexpected, yet was no lessinteresting on that account. A hand--_the_ hand--curiously made ofbronze, and of exquisite proportions, lay on its enamelled cushion, withrings on all of its fingers save one. That one I was delighted to seewas the middle one, proof positive that the mischief contemplated byMiss Calhoun had not yet been accomplished.Restored to complete self-possession by this discovery, I examined thebox and its contents with an air of polite curiosity. I surprised myselfby my self-possession and _bonhomie_."What an odd thing to find in a physician's office!" I exclaimed."Beautiful, is it not? An unusual work of art; but there is nothing init to alarm you. You shouldn't allow yourself to be frightened at sucha thing as that." And with a quick action, she was wholly powerless toprevent, I shut down the lid, which closed with a snap.Startled and greatly discomposed, she drew back, hastily thrusting herhand behind her."You are very officious," she began, but, seeing nothing but good naturein the smile with which I regarded her, she faltered irresolutely, andfinally took refuge again in her former trick of invalidism. Breakingout into low moanings, she fell back upon the nearest chair, from whichshe immediately started again with the quick cry, "Oh, how I suffer! Iam not well enough to be out alone." And turning with a celerity thatbelied her words, she fled into the hall, shutting the door violentlybehind her.Astonished at the completeness of my victory, I spent the first momentsof triumph in trying to lift the lid of the box. But it was securelylocked. I was just debating whether I could now venture to return to myseat, when the hall door reopened and a gentleman entered.He was short, sturdy and had a bristling black mustache. I needed tolook at him but once to be certain he was interested both in the box andme, and, while I gave no evidence of my discovery, I prepared myselffor an adventure of a much more serious nature than that which had justoccupied me.Modeling my behavior upon that of the young girl whose place I hadusurped, I placed my elbow on the box and looked out of the window. AsI did so I heard a shuffling in the adjoining room, and knew that inanother moment the doctor would again appear at the door to announcethat he was ready for another patient. How could I evade the summons?The man behind me was a determined one. He was there for the purposeof opening the box, and would not be likely to leave the room while Iremained in it. How, then, could I comply with the requirements of thesituation and yet prevent this new-comer from lifting the lid in myabsence? I knew of but one way--a way which had suggested itself tome during the long watches of the previous night, and which I had comeprepared to carry out.Taking advantage of my proximity to the box, I inserted in the keyhole asmall morsel of wax which for some minutes past I had been warming inmy hand. This done, I laid my hat down on the lid, noting with greatexactness as I did so just where its rim lay in reference to the varioussquares and scrolls with which the top was ornamented. By this means Ifelt that I might know if the hat were moved in my absence. The doctorhaving showed himself by this time, I followed him into his office witha calmness born of the most complete confidence in the strategy I hademployed.Dr. Merriam, whom I have purposely refrained from describing until now,was a tall, well-made man, with a bald head and a pleasant eye, butcareless in his attire and bearing. As I met that eye and responded tohis good-natured greeting, I inwardly decided that his interest in thebox was much less than his guardianship of it would seem to betoken.And when I addressed him and entered upon the subject of my friend'scomplaint, I soon saw by the depth of his professional interest thatwhatever connection he might have with the box, neither that nor anyother topic whatever could for a moment vie with his delight in a newand strange case like that of my poor friend. I consequently enteredinto the medical details demanded of me with a free mind and succeededin getting some very valuable advice, for which I was of course trulygrateful.As soon as this was accomplished I took my leave, but not by the usualdoor of egress. Saying that I had left my hat in the ante-room, I bowedmy acknowledgments to the doctor and returned the way I came. But notwithout meeting with a surprise. There was still but one person in theroom with the box, but that person was not the man with the bristlingmustache and determined eye whom I had expected to find there. It wasthe pretty, Quaker-like girl who had formerly aroused my suspicions; andthough she sat far from the box, a moment's glance at her flushed faceand trembling hands assured me she had but that moment left it.Going at once to the box, I saw that my hat had been moved. But moresignificant still was the hairpin lying on the floor at my feet, witha morsel of wax sticking to one of its points. This was conclusive. Theman had discovered why his key would not work, and had called to his aidthe young lady, who had evidently been waiting in the hall outside.She had tried to pick out the wax--a task in which I had happilyinterrupted her.Proud of the success of my device, and satisfied that the danger wasover for that day (it being well on to twelve o'clock), I said a fewwords more to the doctor, who had followed me into the room, and thenprepared to take my departure. But the young lady was more agile than I.Saying something about a very pressing engagement which would not allowher to consult the doctor that day, she hurried ahead of me and ranquickly down the long hall. The doctor looked astonished, but dismissedthe matter with a shrug; while, with the greatest desire to follow her,I stood hesitating on the threshold, when my eye fell on a small objectlying under the chair on which she had been sitting. It was the littleleathern bag I had seen hanging at her side.Catching it up, I explained that I would run after the young lady andrestore it; and glad of an excuse which would enable me to follow herthrough the streets without risking the suspicion of impropriety, Ihastened down the stairs and happily succeeded in reaching the pavementbefore her skirts whisked round the corner. I was therefore but a fewpaces behind her, which distance I took good care to preserve.My motive in following this young girl was not so much to restoreher property, as to see where her engagement was taking her. I feltconfident that none of the three persons who had shown interest in thebox was the prime mover in an affair so important; and it was necessaryabove all things to find out who the prime mover was. So I followed thegirl.She led me into a doubtful quarter of the town. As the crowd between usdiminished and we reached a point where we were the only pedestrians onthe block we were then traversing, I grew anxious lest she should turnand see me before arriving at her destination. But she evidently waswithout suspicion, for she passed without any hesitation up a certainstoop in the middle of this long block and entered an open door on whicha brass plate was to be seen, inscribed with this one word in largeblack letters:"MADAME."This was odd; and as I had no inclination to encounter any "madame"without some hint as to her character and business, I looked about mefor some one able and willing to give me the necessary information.An upholsterer's shop in an opposite basement seemed to offer me theopportunity I wanted. Crossing the street, I saluted the honest-lookingman I met in the doorway, and pointing out madame's house, asked whatwas done over there.He answered with a smile."Go and see," he said; "the door's open. Oh, they don't chargeanything," he made haste to protest, misunderstanding, no doubt, my airof hesitation. "I was in there once myself. They all sit round and shetalks; that is, if she feels like it. It is all nonsense, you know, sir;no good in it.""But is there any harm?" I asked. "Is the place reputable and safe?""Oh, safe enough; I never heard of anything going wrong there. Why,ladies go there; real ladies; veiled, of course. I have seen twocarriages at a time standing in front of that door. Fools, to be sure,sir; but honest enough, I suppose."I needed no further encouragement. Recrossing the street, I enteredthe house which stood so invitingly open, and found myself almostimmediately in a large hall, from which I was ushered by a silentnegress into a long room with so dim and mysterious an interior thatI felt like a man suddenly transported from the bustle of the out-doorworld into the mystic recesses of some Eastern temple.The causes of this effect were simple, A dim light suggesting worship;the faint scent of slowly burning incense; women and men sitting on lowbenches about the walls. In the center, on a kind of raised dais, backedby a drapery of black velvet, a woman was seated, in the semblance ofa Hindoo god, so nearly did her heavy, compactly crouched figure, woundabout with Eastern stuffs and glistening with gold, recall the images weare accustomed to associate with the worship of Vishnu. Her face, too,so far as it was visible in the subdued light, had the unresponsivenessof carven wood, and if not exactly hideous of feature, had in it astrange and haunting quality calculated to impress a sensitive mindwith a sense of implacable fate. Cruel, hard, passionless, and yetthreatening to a degree, must this countenance have seemed to those whowillingly subjected themselves to its baneful influence.I was determined not to be one of these, and yet I had not regarded herfor two minutes before I found myself forgetting the real purpose of myvisit, and taking a seat with the rest, in anticipation of something forwhich as yet I had no name, even in my own mind.How long I sat there motionless I do not know. A spell was on me--aspell from which I suddenly roused with a start. Why or through whatmeans I do not know. Nobody else had moved. Fearing a relapse intothis trance-like state, I made a persistent effort to be freed from itsdangers. Happily the full signification of my errand there burst uponme. Finding myself really awake, I ventured to peer about, expecting tosee the more willing devotees affected as I had been. I encountered aflash from the eyes of the young lady whose bag I held in my hand. Shewas under no spell. She had not only seen but recognized me.I held the bag towards her. She gave a furtive glance in the directionof Madame--a glance not free from fear--then clutched the bag. Beforereleasing my hold upon it I ventured upon a word of explanation. I gotno further, for at this moment a voice was heard.By the effect it had upon the expectant ones, I knew it could haveemanated only from the idol-like being who had filled the place with herawesome personality.At first the voice sounded like a distant call, musically sweet and low;the kind of note that we can imagine the Indian snake-charmers touse when the cobra raises its winged head in obedience to the pipe'sresistless charm. Every ear was strained to hear; mine with the rest. Somuch preparation, so much faith must result in something. What was it tobe? The incoherent sounds became more and more distinct, and, finally,took on the articulate form of words. The quiet was deathly. Every onewas prepared to interpret her utterances into personal significance.The dread and trouble of the times filling all minds, men wished to beforehanded with the decrees of Providence. Into this brooding silencethe low, vibrating tones of this mysterious voice entered, and this iswhat we heard:"_Doom! doom! For him--the one--the betrayer--the passing bell istolling. Hear it, ye weak ones and grow strong. Hear it, ye mighty andtremble. Not alone for him will it ring. For ye! for ye! if the decreeof the linked rings goes forth---_"Here there was a perceptible quiver of the drapery back of the dais.Others may not have noted it; I did. When, therefore, a very white handcame slowly from between its folds and placed its fingers upon the righttemple of Madame, I was not much startled. What did startle me wasthe fact let out before that admonishing hand touched her, that thisbeing--I can hardly call her woman--seemingly so far removed from thepolitical agitations of the day, was, in very deed, either consciouslyor unconsciously--I could not decide which--intimately connectedwith the conspiracy I was at that very moment striving to defeat.How intimately? Was she the prime mover I was seeking, or simply aninstrument under the control of another, and yet stronger, personalityimaged in the owner of that white hand?There was no means of determining at that moment. Meanwhile, the fingershad left the temple of Madame. The hand was slowly withdrawn. Sleepapparently fell again upon the dreamer, but only long enough for her tobring forth the words:"I have said."The silence that followed, gave me time to think. It was necessary.She had bidden the mighty tremble and had pronounced death to one--thebetrayer. Was this senseless drivel, prophetic sight, or threatenedmurder? I inclined to consider it the last, and this was why: For someweeks now, murder, or, at least, sudden death, had been rampant inthe country. My flesh crept as I remembered the many mysterious deathsreported within the month from St. Louis, Boston, New Orleans, New Yorkand even here in Baltimore. Like a flash it came across me that everyname was identified, more or less closely, with the political affairs ofthe time. Coupling my knowledge with what I conjectured, was it strangeI saw a confirmation of the worst fears expressed by Miss Calhoun in thehalf-completed sentences of this seeming clairvoyant?So occupied had I been with my own thoughts that I feared I might havedone something to call an undesirable attention to myself. Glancingfurtively to one side, I heard, in the opposite direction, these words:"She has never failed. What she has said will come to pass. Some one ofnote will die."These gloomy words were the first to break the ominous silence.Turning to face the speaker, I encountered the cold eye of a man with aretreating chin, a receding forehead, and a mouth large and cruel enoughto stamp him as one of those perverted natures who, to the unscrupulous,are usefully insane.Here, then, was a being who not only knew the meaning of the fatefulwords we had heard, but, to my mind, could be relied upon to make them averity.It was a relief to me to turn my gaze from his repellant features to thefixed countenance of Madame. She had not stirred; but either the roomhad grown lighter or my eyes had become more accustomed to the darkness,for I certainly saw a change in her look. Her eyelids were now raised,and her eyes were bent directly upon me. This was uncomfortable,especially as there was malevolence in her glance, or so I thought,and, far from being pleased with my position, I began to wish that Ihad never allowed myself to enter the place. Under the influence of thisfeeling I let my eyes drop from the woman's countenance to her hands,which were folded, as I have said, in a fixed position across herbreast. The result was an increase of my mental disturbance. They werebrown, shining hands, laden with rings, and, in the added light, underwhich I saw them, bore a strange resemblance to the bronze hand I hadjust left in Dr. Merriam's office.I had never considered myself a weak man, but, from that instant, Ibegan to have a crawling fear of this woman--a fear that was in nowiselessened by the very evident agitation visible in the girl, who had beenfor me the connecting link between that object of mystery and this.Unendurable quiet was upon us all again. It was aggravated by awe--anawe to which I was determined not to succumb, notwithstanding the secretuneasiness under which I was laboring. So I let my eyes continue toroam, till they fell upon the one thing moving in the room. This was aman's foot, which I now saw projecting from behind the drapery throughwhich I had seen the white hand glide. It was swinging up and down in animpatient way, so out of keeping with the emotions perceptible on thisside of the drapery that I felt forced to ask myself what sort of personthis could be who thus kept watch and ward with such very commonplaceimpatience over a creature who was able to hold every other person inher presence under a spell. The drapery did not give up its secrets, andagain I yielded to the fascinations of Madame's face.There was a change in it; the eyes no longer looked my way, but intospace, which seemed to hold for them some terrible and heart-rendingvision. The lips, which had been closed, were now parted, and from themissued a breath which soon formed itself into words."'Vengeance is mine! I will repay,' saith the Lord." What passionateutterance was this? The voice that had been musical now rang withjangling discord. The swinging of the foot behind the drapery ceased.Madame spoke on:"Through pain, sorrow, blood and death shall victory come. Life forlife, pang for pang, scorn for scorn!"The swinging foot disappeared, and the small white hand passed quicklythrough the curtain and rested again upon the forehead of Madame. Butwithout a calming effect this time. On the contrary, it seemed to urgeand incite her, for she broke into a new strain, speaking rapidly,wildly, as if she lived in what she saw, or, what was doubtless truer,had lived in it and was but recalling her own past in one of thoseterrible hours of memory that recur on the border-land of dreams."I see a child, a girl. She is young; she is beautiful. Men love her,many men, but she loves only one. He is of the North; she is of theSouth. He is icy like his clime; she is fiery like her skies. The firecannot warm the ice. It is the ice puts out the fire! Woe! woe!"The left hand came from the drapery; found its way to the left templeof the woman. But it, too, was ineffectual. Hurriedly, madly, the wordswent on, tripping each other up in their haste and passion. The voicenow became hoarse with rage."The girl is now a woman. A child is given her. The man demands thechild. She will not give it up. He curses it; he curses her, but she isfirm and holds it to her breast till her arms are blackened by the blowshe deals her. Then he curses her _country_, the land that gave her a_heart_; and, hearing this, she rises up and curses him and his with anoath the Lord will hear and answer from His judgment throne. _For thechild was slain between them_ and its pitiful, small body blocks thepassage of Mercy between his and hers forever. Woe! woe!"As suddenly as the vehement change had come upon her, she had becomecalm again. The eyes retained their stony stare, but a cold and cruelsmile formed about her lips, as if, with the utterance of that lastword, she saw a futurity of blood and carnage satisfying her ferocioussoul.It was revolting, horrible; but no one else seemed to feel it as I did.To most it was a short glimpse into a suffering soul. To me it was therevelation of causes which had led, and would lead yet, to miseries forwhich she had no pity, and which I felt myself too weak to avert.That it was not intended that the devotees of Madame should have heardthese ravings was evident; for at this juncture the owner of the twowhite hands that had failed to control the spirit of Madame came outfrom behind the drapery of the dais. He proved to be none other thanthe man with the bristling mustache whose plans I had disarranged at thedoctor's office by plugging the keyhole of the box with wax.This was enough. "Chicanery!" was my inmost thought as I noted his cooland calculating eye. "But very dangerous chicanery," I added. Was thering upon whose immediate capture I now saw that a life, if not lives,depended, in his possession, or in that of Madame, or in that of theQuaker-like girl sitting a few seats from me? How impossible to tell,and yet how imperative to know! As I was debating how this could bebrought about, I watched the man.Self-control was a habit with him, but I saw the nervous clutch of hisdelicate hand. This did not indicate complete mastery of himself atthat moment. He spoke with care, but as if he were in haste to deliverhimself of the few necessary words of dismissal, without betraying hislack of composure."Madame will awake presently; she will be heard no more to-day. Thosewho wish to kiss her robes may pass in front of her; but she is stilltoo far away from earth to hear your voices or to answer any questions.You will therefore preserve silence."So! so! more chicanery. Or was it strategy, pure and simple? Was thereat the bottom of his words the wish to see me nearer or was he justplaying with the credulity of such believers as the man next me, forinstance? I did not stop to determine. My anxiety to see Madame, withoutthe illusion of even the short distance between us, induced me to jointhe file of the faithful who were slowly approaching the seated woman.I would not kiss her robes, but I would look into her eyes and make surethat she was as far away from us all as she was said to be.But as I drew nearer to her I forgot all about her eyes in the interestawakened by her hands. And when it came my turn to pause before her,it was upon the middle finger of her right hand my eyes were fixed. Forthere I saw THE RING; the veritable ring of my fair neighbor, if thedescription given by her was correct.To see it there was to have it; or so I vowed in my surprise andself-confidence. Putting on an air of great dignity, I bowed to thewoman and passed on, resolving upon the course I would pursue, whichmust necessarily be daring in order to succeed. At the door I pausedtill all who followed me had passed out; then I turned back, and onceagain faced Madame.She was alone. Her watchful guardian had left her side, and to allappearances the room. The opportunity surpassed my expectations, andwith a step full of nerve I pushed forward and took my stand againdirectly in front of her. She gave no token of seeing me; but I did nothesitate on that account. Exerting all my will power, I first subjectedher to a long and masterful look, and then I spoke, directly and to thepoint, like one who felt himself her superior,"Madame," said I, "the man you wish for is here. Give me the ring, andtrust no more to weak or false emissaries."The start with which she came to life, or to the evidence of life,was surprising. Lifting her great lids, she returned my gaze with oneequally searching and powerful, and seeing with what disdain I sustainedit, allowed an almost imperceptible tremor to pass across her face,which up to now had not displayed the shadow even of an emotion."You!" she murmured, in a dove-like tone of voice; "who are you that Ishould trust you more than the others?""I am he you expect," said I, venturing more as I felt her impassibilitygiving way before me. "Have you had no premonition of my coming? Did younot know that he who controls would be in your presence to-day?"She trembled, and her fingers almost unclasped from her arms."I have had dreams," she murmured, "but I have been bidden to beware ofdreams. If you are the person you claim to be, you will have some tokenwhich will absolve me from the charge of credulity. What is your token?"Though doubtful, I dared not hesitate. "This," I said, taking from mypocket the key which had been given me by my fair neighbor.She moved, she touched it with a finger; then she eyed me again."Others have keys," said she, "but they fail in the opening. How are youbetter than they?""You know," I declared--"you know that I can do what others have failedin. Give me the ring."The force, the assurance with which I uttered this command moved her inspite of herself. She trembled, gave me one final, searching look, andslowly began to pull the ring from off her finger. It was in her hand,and half way to mine, when a third voice came to break the spell."Madame, Madame," it said; "be careful. This is the man who clogged thelock, and hindered my endeavors in your behalf in the doctor's office."Her hand which was so near mine drew back; but I was too quick and toodetermined for her. I snatched the ring before she could replace it onher own hand, and, holding it firmly, faced the intruder with an air ofvery well-assumed disdain."Attempt no argument with me. It was because I saw your weaknessand vulgar self-confidence that I interfered in a matter only to beundertaken by one upon whom all can rely. Now that I have the ring,the end is near. Madame, be wiser in the choice of your confidants,_To-morrow this ring will be in its proper place_."Bowing as I had done before, I advanced to the door. They had made noeffort to regain the ring, and I felt that my rashness had stood me ingood stead. But as, with a secret elation I was just capable of keepingwithin bounds, I put my foot across the threshold, I heard behind me alaugh so triumphant and mocking that I felt struck with consternation;and, glancing down into my hand, I saw that I held, not the peculiarsteel circlet destined for the piece of mechanism in the doctor'soffice, but an ordinary ring of gold.She had offered me the wrong ring, _and I had taken it_, thus provingthe falsity of my pretensions.There was nothing left for me but to acknowledge defeat by anignominious departure.I HASTENED at once home, and knocked at Miss Calhoun's door. Whilewaiting for a response, the mockery of my return without the token I hadundertaken to restore to her, impressed itself upon me in full force. Itseemed to me that in that instant my face must have taken on a haggardlook. I could not summon up the necessary will to make it otherwise.Any effort in that direction would have made my failure at cheerfulnesspitiable.The door opened. There she stood. Whatever expectancy of success she mayhave had fled at once. Our eyes met and her countenance changed. My facemust have told the whole story, for she exclaimed:"You have failed!"I was obliged to acknowledge it in a whisper, but hastened to assure herthat the ring had not yet been placed upon the bronze hand, and was notlikely to be till the lock had been cleaned, out. This interested her,and called out a hurried but complete recital of my adventure. She hungupon it breathlessly, and when I reached the point where Madame and herprophetic voice entered the tale, she showed so much excitement that anydoubts I may have cherished as to the importance of the communicationMadame had made us vanished in a cold horror I with difficulty hid frommy companion. But the end agitated her more than the beginning, and whenshe heard that I had taken upon myself a direct connection with thismysterious matter, she grew so pale that I felt forced to inquire if thefolly I had committed was likely to result badly, at which she shudderedand replied:"You have brought death upon yourself. I see nothing but destructionbefore us both. This woman--this horrible woman--has seen your face,and, if she is what you describe, she will never forget it. The man, whois her guardian or agent, no doubt, must have tracked you, and findingyou here with me, from whose hand he himself may have torn the ringlast night, will record it as treason against a cause which punishes alltreason with death."Pshaw!" I ejaculated, with a jocular effort at indifference, which Iacknowledge I did not feel. "You seem to forget the law. We live in thecity of Baltimore. Charlatans such as I have just left behind me do notmake away with good citizens with impunity. We have only to seek theprotection of the police."She met my looks with a slowly increasing intentness, which stilled thisprotest on my lips.
