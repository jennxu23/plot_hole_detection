Detective Cleek arrived at the grand house of Captain Morrison and his daughter, Miss Mary Morrison, where he was warmly greeted by Superintendent Narkom. The atmosphere was heavy with worry as they discussed the mysterious disappearance of Miss Morrison's fiance, George Carboys. The young man had vanished without a trace after donning a peculiar blue leather belt that was rumored to render the wearer invisible.Cleek listened intently as Miss Morrison tearfully recounted the events leading up to George's disappearance. She described how he had received the belt as a gift from a mysterious stranger, and how, upon putting it on, he had vanished right in front of her eyes. Despite a thorough search of the house and its surroundings, there was no sign of George.As Cleek delved deeper into the case, he discovered that George's friend, Van Nant, had a suspiciously strong motive for wanting him out of the way. It was revealed that George had recently inherited a substantial sum of money from a miserly Arab named Abdul ben Meerza, and Van Nant stood to gain significantly from George's disappearance.Determined to uncover the truth, Cleek embarked on a meticulous investigation, following a trail of clues that led him to Van Nant's studio. As he searched the premises, his keen eyes caught sight of a peculiar sculpture that seemed out of place.
