The Thinking Machine, Professor Augustus S.F.X. Van Dusen, sat in his study, his sharp eyes fixed on the two men standing before him â€“ Wilkes, a young man accused of murder, and Johnson, a shady character suspected of involvement in the crime."I have carefully examined all the evidence in this case," began The Thinking Machine in his characteristic precise manner. "And I have come to a conclusion that I believe will shed light on the truth."Wilkes looked hopeful, while Johnson shifted nervously from foot to foot."The key to this mystery lies in the details," continued The Thinking Machine. "In the precise sequence of events leading to the tragic death of Alice Gorham."He began to unravel the threads of the case with his brilliant deductive reasoning, piecing together the clues that had baffled the police. With each revelation, the tension in the room grew palpable."Wilkes," he said, turning to the young man, "you were in the wrong place at the wrong time, inadvertently caught up in a web of deceit and betrayal. You are not the culprit in this case."Wilkes breathed a sigh of relief, a glimmer of hope returning to his eyes.
