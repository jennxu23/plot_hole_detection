It was a crisp autumn morning when Abner and his young nephew, Martin, set out to check on the cattle grazing in the pastureland that once belonged to the ruined Sheriff Smallwood. The sun was just beginning to rise, casting a golden hue over the landscape as they rode side by side.As they made their way through the pasture, Abner's sharp eyes caught sight of unusual tracks in the soft earth. He reined in his horse, causing Martin to do the same, as they both studied the tracks intently. The tracks led them off the main path and into a dense thicket of woods.Curiosity piqued, Abner and Martin followed the tracks deeper into the woods until they stumbled upon a hidden horse tied to a tree. Nearby, they spotted a crowbar lying on the ground, its presence raising suspicions in Abner's mind.Abner's deductive skills kicked into high gear as he pieced together the clues before him. The hidden horse, the crowbar, and the suspicious tracks all painted a picture of deceit and betrayal. Abner knew there was more to this scene than meets the eye, and he was determined to uncover the truth.With Martin following closely behind, Abner continued to unravel the mystery as they made their way to an old graveyard perched atop a nearby hill. The eerie silence of the graveyard added to the tension as Abner's keen observations led him to a shocking revelation.
