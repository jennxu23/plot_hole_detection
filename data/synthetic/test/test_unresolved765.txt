Where is he? I must see him!" The voice belonged to a wild-eyed girl who burst into his office, her chest heaving with panic.Kennedy stood up, concern etching his features. "What's the matter, miss? How can I help you?" he asked, his tone gentle and reassuring.The girl's eyes scanned the room frantically before locking onto Kennedy's. "I... I have to do something terrible. I have to commit murder to save myself," she blurted out, tears glistening in her eyes.Kennedy's brow furrowed in confusion and worry. He motioned for the girl to sit down, offering her a glass of water to calm her nerves. "Take a deep breath and tell me everything. We'll figure this out together," he said in a soothing voice.
