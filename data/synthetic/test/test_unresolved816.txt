Thorpe Hazell was a man of many peculiarities, but his sharp intellect and keen sense of observation never failed him. As a book-collector and railway enthusiast, he spent his days surrounded by dusty tomes and the rhythmic clatter of passing trains. His eccentricities extended to his diet, which consisted mostly of raw vegetables, nuts, and fruits, and his dedication to physical culture, which saw him performing calisthenics and yoga poses in the most unlikely of places.One day, Hazell's routine was disrupted when tobacconist Harry Brett burst into his bookshop, his face flushed with excitement. Brett, a regular customer and a man of keen observation himself, had stumbled upon some suspicious activities involving a rival tobacconist, Peter Crane. Crane, it seemed, was involved in some illicit dealings, using the railway to smuggle contraband goods.Intrigued by the challenge, Hazell set out to investigate the matter. With Brett as his informant, he began to piece together the puzzle, using his sharp intellect and unconventional methods to unravel the mystery. He spent hours at the railway station, observing the comings and goings of the guards and the passengers, looking for any signs of clandestine activity.
