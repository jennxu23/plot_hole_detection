The steamship "Starlight" was a grand vessel, cutting through the vast expanse of the ocean with grace and power. Captain Reynolds was a seasoned seafarer, respected by his crew for his skill and leadership. Among the crew was the second officer, Brasyer, a sharp-eyed and observant man who took his duties very seriously. The steward, Mr. Turner, was a quiet and unassuming man, always seen bustling about attending to the needs of the passengers and crew.Unknown to the rest of the crew, a group of cunning thieves had managed to infiltrate the ship under the guise of travelers. Their plan was to steal a shipment of gold bullion being transported on the "Starlight" and make their escape without anyone suspecting a thing. The thieves knew they needed inside help to pull off their heist successfully, and they found willing accomplices in both the captain and the steward.As the journey progressed, Brasyer began to notice suspicious behavior from Captain Reynolds and Mr. Turner. They seemed to be sharing secretive glances and engaging in covert conversations.
