Dr. Stephen Halifax hastily packed his medical bag after receiving a urgent note from his friend, Dr. Jonathan Ray. The note, written in a shaky hand, requested Dr. Halifax's immediate assistance in the small coastal town of Saltmarsh. Dr. Ray, who had been serving as a locum tenens for Dr. Ogilvie, was in need of help due to a sudden illness that had befallen Mrs. Ogilvie.Upon arriving in Saltmarsh, Dr. Halifax was greeted by Dr. Roper, the attending physician at the local clinic. Dr. Roper led Dr. Halifax to the Ogilvie residence, where they found Mrs. Ogilvie lying pale and unconscious in her bed. Dr. Halifax wasted no time in examining the patient and quickly determined that she was suffering from symptoms of opium poisoning.Dr. Roper, however, was skeptical of Dr. Halifax's diagnosis. He insisted that Mrs. Ogilvie had been suffering from a simple case of influenza and refused to entertain the idea of opium poisoning. Despite the disagreement, Dr. Halifax began administering the necessary treatment to counteract the effects of the poison.As Dr. Halifax worked tirelessly to save Mrs. Ogilvie's life, Dr. Roper stumbled upon a letter from Dr. Ogilvie that shed light on the tragic events that had unfolded. In the letter, Dr. Ogilvie confessed his intention to end his own life due to the relentless blackmail and lies of his first wife's family. Dr. Halifax realized that the situation was far more complex than he had initially thought.Driven by a sense of urgency, Dr. Halifax and Dr. Roper raced against time to uncover the truth behind Dr. Ogilvie's despair. They sought out the first wife's family and confronted them about their deceitful actions.
