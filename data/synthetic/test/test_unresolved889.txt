District Attorney Carton paced back and forth in his office, the weight of the situation pressing heavily on his shoulders. A mysterious package had been delivered to the Criminal Courts Building, and all signs pointed to it being a bomb. With a sense of urgency, he summoned the renowned detective Craig Kennedy and his trusty sidekick, Walter Jameson, to investigate the potentially deadly threat.Kennedy wasted no time in carefully examining the package, his skilled hands working swiftly to dissect it without triggering any potential explosives within. As the layers were peeled back, evidence of a dangerous explosive was uncovered, confirming their worst fears. The clock was ticking, and the pressure was mounting to locate the source of the bomb before it could cause any harm.Using his keen intellect and cutting-edge technology, Kennedy traced the bomb back to a sophisticated bomb factory hidden within a rundown tenement house on the outskirts of the city. Armed with a thermopile device to detect any heat signatures inside, Kennedy and Walter approached the building with caution, knowing they were walking into a potentially volatile situation.As Kennedy scanned the building, he detected a faint heat signature coming from within the bomb factory. With a determined look in his eyes, he swiftly set up a hydraulic ram to break through the fortified door, ready to confront whoever was responsible for the deadly device.Inside, they found the notorious bomb-maker, Haddon, and his accomplice, Loraine Keith, unconscious on the floor, the remnants of cocaine scattered around them. It became clear that not only was Haddon a skilled bomb-maker, but he was also a drug fiend, using his illicit activities to fuel his dangerous habits.As Haddon and Loraine were roused from their drug-induced stupor, the full extent of their crimes began to unravel.
