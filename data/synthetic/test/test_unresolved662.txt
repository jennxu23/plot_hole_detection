On a rainy evening, the phone in Craig's office rang insistently. I watched as his expression grew serious upon hearing the urgency in the voice of the caller. It was a distraught individual who claimed, "Mr. Kennedy—I am ruined—ruined!"Craig wasted no time. He grabbed his coat, hat, and briefcase, and we hurried into the pouring rain, heading towards Josephson's Baths in the heart of the city. The news of lawyer Owen Minturn's sudden death due to electric shock had sent shockwaves through the legal community.As we arrived at the scene, the atmosphere was tense. Joseph Josephson, the proprietor of the baths, greeted us nervously, his eyes darting around as if searching for an escape. Craig's keen eyes immediately picked up on the unease in Josephson's demeanor."What happened here, Josephson?" Craig inquired calmly, his voice cutting through the tension like a knife.Josephson stammered out a disjointed explanation of Minturn's tragic demise, emphasizing that it was a dreadful accident. However, Craig's sharp observations and probing questions hinted at a deeper mystery lurking beneath the surface.With meticulous attention to detail, Craig examined the electric bath setup, analyzing the circuitry and the components involved. He discovered minute white crystals on the electrodes, which he recognized as a substance not commonly associated with electric baths—strychnin salts.
