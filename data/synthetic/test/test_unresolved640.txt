It was a rainy evening when a visitor arrived at Dorcas Dene's elegant office in the heart of London. The visitor was a tall and distinguished gentleman, his face etched with lines of worry and confusion. Dorcas Dene greeted him warmly, her sharp eyes taking in every detail of his appearance."Good evening, Lord Helsham," Dorcas said, her voice calm and reassuring. "Please, have a seat. How can I assist you today?"Lord Helsham took a deep breath and began to recount the events that had led him to seek Dorcas Dene's help. He spoke of his sudden disappearance, the whispers and rumors that had circulated in the wake of his vanishing, and the deep secrets that had haunted him for years.
