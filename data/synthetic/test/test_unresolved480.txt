Mr. Guy Lampard was a man of sharp intellect and keen observation. As a junior partner at Scriven, Lampard, and Polkinghorne, he had dealt with his fair share of complex cases and intricate investigations. However, nothing could have prepared him for the mysterious disappearance of the valuable Selchester Missal from the cathedral library.The urgent telegram from the Dean of Selchester had summoned Lampard to the historic city, and he wasted no time in making his way there. Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the anxious Dean, who led him to the library where the Missal had been kept under lock and key.As Lampard examined the case where the Missal had been stored, his sharp eyes caught sight of a pendant lying on the velvet lining. It was an exquisite piece of jewelry, undoubtedly belonging to a woman of refined taste and wealth. The name inscribed on the back of the pendant read "Mrs. Vanderkiste."
