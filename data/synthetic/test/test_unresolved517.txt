It was a rainy autumn evening when Miss Polly Burton, a young and ambitious journalist, received a distressing phone call from her friend, Mr. Richard Frobisher. His voice was urgent and grave as he informed her of the shocking murder of Mrs. Owen, the caretaker of Rubens Studios, a renowned art gallery in the heart of London.Miss Burton's curiosity was piqued, and without hesitation, she rushed to the scene of the crime. The police were already there, cordoning off the area and questioning witnesses. Mr. Frobisher was waiting for her at the entrance, his brow furrowed with concern."Polly, I'm glad you're here," he said, his voice low. "This is a most perplexing case."Together, they entered the studio where Mrs. Owen's body lay sprawled on the floor, a look of terror frozen on her face. The room was in disarray, with overturned furniture and scattered art supplies. It was evident that a struggle had taken place.As they examined the scene, Miss Burton and Mr. Frobisher exchanged theories and observations. Mrs. Owen's nephew, a young man named Simon, was the prime suspect, as he had a strained relationship with his aunt and stood to inherit her estate. However, there was no concrete evidence linking him to the crime.Miss Burton's keen eye caught a peculiar detailâ€”a thin string hanging from a hook on the ceiling, with one end frayed as if it had been cut. She pointed it out to Mr. Frobisher, who immediately grasped the significance of the improvised sash-line."This string was used to manipulate the scene," he mused.
