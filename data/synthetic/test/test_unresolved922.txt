On a foggy evening in late September, the Orient Express hurtled through the English countryside, its passengers nestled in their compartments, unaware of the sinister events that were about to unfold. Among them was the enigmatic detective Cleek, his sharp eyes missing nothing as he observed his fellow travelers with a keen interest.The peace of the train was shattered when a blood-curdling scream echoed through the carriages. Cleek was on his feet in an instant, his mind already racing through the possibilities. Rushing down the corridor, he arrived at the scene of the crime—a compartment in disarray, with the lifeless body of Lord Stavornell slumped in his seat.As Cleek conducted his initial examination, it became clear that this was no ordinary murder. The window was sealed shut, the door locked from the inside, and there was no weapon to be found. The other passengers were in a state of shock, each professing their innocence and ignorance of the crime.But Cleek knew better. With his sharp observation and deductive reasoning, he began to piece together the puzzle. As he interviewed each passenger, subtle details began to emerge—small inconsistencies, nervous glances, and telling gestures that hinted at hidden motives.It was during his conversation with the Hon. Mrs. Brinkworth, a wealthy widow traveling with her son and her alleged brother-in-law, Colonel Murchison, that Cleek's suspicions were confirmed. Mrs. Brinkworth's demeanor shifted imperceptibly as Cleek probed deeper into her connection with Lord Stavornell and the estate he was set to inherit.Through careful questioning and clever manipulation, Cleek managed to extract a confession from Mrs. Brinkworth.
