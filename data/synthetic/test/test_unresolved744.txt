The night was dark and still as Hutchinson Hatch, a seasoned reporter, sat alone in his small apartment, the glow of the streetlights casting eerie shadows on the walls. Suddenly, the shrill ring of the telephone pierced the silence, making him jump in his seat. With a sense of trepidation, he picked up the receiver."Hello?" he said, his voice filled with anticipation."Mr. Hatch, this is The Thinking Machine," came the calm, measured voice on the other end of the line.Hatch's heart skipped a beat. The Thinking Machine was a renowned scientist known for his brilliant deductive reasoning and ability to solve even the most baffling mysteries. It was rare for him to reach out to Hatch directly."What can I do for you, Professor?" Hatch asked, his curiosity piqued."I need you to go to the old oak tree in the abandoned lot at the edge of town," The Thinking Machine instructed. "There, you will find a piece of string with knots tied in it. Bring it to me immediately."Hatch's mind raced with questions, but he knew better than to disobey The Thinking Machine's orders. Without hesitation, he grabbed his coat and keys, and headed out into the night.As he made his way to the secluded location, Hatch's thoughts were consumed by the mystery of the task he had been given. What could a piece of string with knots tied in it possibly signify? And why was The Thinking Machine involved in this cryptic message?When Hatch arrived at the old oak tree, he spotted the piece of string hanging from a low branch. He carefully plucked it from the tree and examined the knots, trying to decipher their meaning. Suddenly, a realization dawned on him - the knots were a message, a cry for help.
