It was a rainy afternoon in the bustling city of New York when Craig Kennedy received a frantic call from Mrs. Close, a society woman who had been left crippled for life after undergoing X-ray treatment by Dr. Gregory. As Kennedy listened to her tearful account of the events that had unfolded, he knew that this was no ordinary case.With his trusty assistant, Walter James, by his side, Kennedy made his way to Mrs. Close's lavish estate on the outskirts of the city. The grand mansion stood imposingly against the grey sky, a stark contrast to the turmoil and despair that lay within its walls.Upon their arrival, Kennedy and Walter were ushered into the drawing-room by the stoic butler. Mrs. Close, a once-beautiful woman now confined to a wheelchair, greeted them with a mixture of relief and trepidation."Mr. Kennedy, I am so grateful that you have come," she began, her voice trembling with emotion. "Dr. Gregory has ruined my life, and I need your help to bring him to justice."Kennedy listened intently as Mrs. Close recounted the details of her tragic experience—the promise of beauty through X-ray treatment, the excruciating pain that followed, and the devastating realization that she would never walk again. It was a heartbreaking tale of betrayal and deceit, and Kennedy vowed to uncover the truth.His first stop was Dr. Gregory's clinic, a sterile and clinical environment that reeked of antiseptic. The doctor himself was a formidable figure, with a cold demeanor that belied his profession. As Kennedy questioned him about Mrs. Close's treatment, Dr. Gregory's answers were evasive and his explanations unsatisfactory.Undeterred, Kennedy delved deeper into the case, following a trail of clues that led him to a hidden laboratory on the outskirts of the city. There, he made a shocking discovery—a cache of radium, a highly radioactive substance that had been used in a sinister plot to ruin Mrs. Close's beauty.With this damning evidence in hand, Kennedy orchestrated a clever plan to expose the culprits behind the conspiracy. He arranged a meeting with Mrs. Close, her husband, Mr. Close, and their attorney, Lawrence, in Dr. Gregory's laboratory under the guise of discussing a settlement for the lawsuit.As the unsuspecting trio gathered in the dimly lit room, Kennedy activated a hidden microphone that captured their every word. The tension in the air was palpable as he confronted them with the evidence of their misdeeds, laying bare the truth behind Mrs. Close's tragic fate.
