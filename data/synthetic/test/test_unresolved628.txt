Van Dusen. The professor's keen intellect and analytical skills were well-known, and they hoped he could shed some light on the baffling situation. As they discussed the case, a plan began to form in the professor's mind.Meanwhile, champion long-distance bicyclist Jimmie Thalhauer was brought into the fold. His exceptional skills and speed on a bicycle made him the perfect candidate to track the phantom auto to its destination. The team was now ready to unravel the mystery behind the disappearing car.On the next night of their watch, Baker and Bowman were on high alert as they awaited the appearance of the phantom auto. Suddenly, the dazzling white lights of the speeding car came into view, hurtling down the road towards them. Baker attempted to stop the car, but it raced past them, disappearing into The Trap once again.With a sense of urgency, the team sprang into action.
