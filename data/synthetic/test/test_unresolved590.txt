It was a humid summer evening in South Boston when a scream pierced the night, shattering the quiet of the tenement building on Chestnut Street. The neighbors rushed to Fred Boyd's room, only to find him lying lifeless on the floor, a look of horror frozen on his face. The police were called, and soon the place was swarming with detectives and reporters eager to uncover the truth behind the mysterious murder.Among the crowd of onlookers stood Frank Cunningham, a tall, stoic man who had been seen visiting Boyd earlier that evening. Suspicion quickly fell on him, especially when it was revealed that Boyd and Cunningham had a heated argument about Cunningham's impending marriage to Caroline Pierce, a beautiful young woman from the neighborhood.As the detectives combed through Boyd's room for clues, Cunningham found himself at the center of a storm of accusations and rumors. The press hounded him, painting him as a jealous lover driven to commit a heinous crime in a fit of passion. But Cunningham maintained his innocence, adamant that he had nothing to do with Boyd's death.Amidst the chaos and confusion, a renowned sleuth known as The Thinking Machine arrived on the scene. With his keen intellect and sharp eye for detail, The Thinking Machine began to piece together the puzzle of Boyd's murder. While everyone was focused on Cunningham, The Thinking Machine turned his attention to a seemingly insignificant detailâ€”a broken aquarium in the corner of Boyd's room.
