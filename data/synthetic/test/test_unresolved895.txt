The sun beat down mercilessly on the crowded streets of London as the two young lawyers' clerks, James and Henry, hurriedly made their way through the bustling city with the deed-box belonging to the estate of the late Edward Burley. The box contained important documents that needed to be delivered to the offices of Clinton & Hills by the end of the day. The weight of the heavy box, coupled with the oppressive heat, made their journey even more arduous.As they passed by a quaint old pub, Henry suggested they take a short break to cool off and have a refreshing drink. James reluctantly agreed, knowing they couldn't afford to waste too much time. As they sat at a table outside the pub, a mysterious stranger approached them and asked if he could join them for a drink. He was a tall, gaunt man with piercing eyes that seemed to bore into their very souls.The stranger introduced himself as Mr. Blackwood and engaged them in conversation, asking about their work and the contents of the deed-box. James and Henry, feeling uneasy but unable to refuse his company, answered his questions politely. However, as they finished their drinks and prepared to leave, they were shocked to discover that the deed-box had mysteriously vanished.Panic set in as James and Henry frantically searched the area, but the box was nowhere to be found.
