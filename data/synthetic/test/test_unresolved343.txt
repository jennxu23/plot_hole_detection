﻿I am generally far too busy to leave town for Christmas, but one December comes vividly now before my memory, when, feeling the need of change and partial rest, I was induced to spend a week with my friends, the Onslows, at their beautiful country seat in Hampshire.The house was full of guests, several of whom I knew already. My host was an old college friend; his wife was a distant relation of my own. For the first day or two of my visit I almost forgot that I was a doctor, and enjoyed the merry season as thoroughly as the youngest present.There were three guests in the house who from the very first aroused my strong interest. One of these was a bright-looking young fellow of the name of Oliver; the others were two young girls, one of eighteen, the other a child of ten.The open secret quickly reached my ears that Oliver and Frances Wilton were engaged to be married. They were a devoted couple — ^at least, that was my first impression; I had reason afterwards to fancy that the devotion was mostly on the part of the lover, and that the young lady, beautiful as she was to look at, had that callous nature to which strong feeling was impossible.Miss Wilton was a contrast to her little sister, who was a perfect whirlwind of impetuosity, high spirits, laughter, and noise. The little girl, whose name was Rosamond, was a favourite with everyone in the house, and as she happened to be the only child of the party, all kinds of liberties were permitted to her.On the morning of my third day at Holmwood, I was strolling through the shrubberies after breakfast when I came face to face with my host, Jack Onslow, in earnest conversation with Captain Oliver."Look here," said Jack, the moment he met me, "you are the very man I want. Here's Oliver in a dreadful state of mind. I tell him he cannot do better than consult you. You will quickly show him that he is merely suffering from an attack of the nerves.""But you have noticed it yourself — confess that you have," said Oliver, turning and looking full at his host."Oh, I confess nothing," said Jack. "You had better confide in Halifax. Have a cigar, Halifax? Now I will leave you and Jim to have your conference together."Whether Oliver would have confided in me at that moment I cannot say, but before I could accept Onslow's cigar or make any suitable reply, a shrill little voice was heard calling to us, and the next instant Rosamond Wilton, her hair streaming behind her and her eyes bright from excitement, rushed up." Jim, Jim," she exclaimed, addressing Oliver, " Frances wants you to do something for her. Oh, you needn't go to the house," as he was preparing to start off. "She wants you to go to the chemist at Market Lea at once. Take this note with you. The chemist will give you some medicine that you are to bring back. Please go at once, Jim.""Is Frances ill?" asked Oliver."I don't know — I don't think she is quite well. Anyhow, she wants you to go at once —will you? ""That I will, of course," said Oliver, his face brightening. "Tell her so, Rosamond."Rosamond darted away, and I turned to the young man."I should like a walk," I said; "may I come with you?""With pleasure," he replied.We started immediately, cutting across an open common as the nearest way to the little town.When I saw Oliver talking to Onslow, he seemed undoubtedly depressed, but now he had recovered his usual spirits. He was a handsome young man of about five and twenty, with bright eyes, a resolute face, and an upright bearing. He was a captain in a crack regiment, and I understood that he was rich. I was at least ten years his senior. He represented the happy boy to me, and certainly gave me no hint of any possible cause for melancholy during our brisk walk.We reached the chemist's. I waited outside while Oliver went in to execute his commission. After about a moment's absence he joined me, perturbation now very evident on his face."Look here. Dr. Halifax," he said, "I wonder if you can help me.""With pleasure, if I can," I replied."Well, I wish you would come into the shop and speak to this stupid chemist. He refuses to give me the medicine which Miss Wilton has written for. He says he cannot supply it without a prescription, and that 1 must go back and get one. Frances evidently wants it very badly, and will be vexed at this delay. As you are a doctor, perhaps you can manage the matter."I entered the shop immediately, and went up to the chemist. He was holding Miss Wilton's open letter in his hand."This gentleman is a doctor," said Oliver. "He'll make it all right. You had better let me have the medicine at once, as I know the lady wants it.""Perhaps the doctor will write a prescription," said the chemist."I cannot do so, unless I know what is required," I said. "What medicine has Miss Wilton written for?""Are you her medical attendant, sir?""No.""Then please pardon me, I am not permitted to tell you. This note is confidential,"As he spoke he tore it into several pieces, and flung the fragments beneath the counter."I am sorry to disoblige," he said, "but the contents of Miss Wilton's note are strictly private. If you, sir, as a doctor will see the lady, I have no doubt everything will be put right.""You did well not to betray a confidence," I said, briefly, to the man, and then I hurried Oliver out of the shop.All his good humour and high spirits had left him. He showed more disturbance than I thought the occasion warranted."Don't be distressed," I said to him, soothingly. "If Miss Wilton will allow me, I'll see her as soon as ever we get back to Holmwood, and will supply her with a proper prescription for anything she may require. There is nothing to alarm yourself about in the chemist refusing to supply a certain medicine without a prescription. A chemist lays himself open to a large penalty if he does so. Miss Wilton is probably suffering from toothache, and has sent for chloroform or something of that nature.""Oh, it is not this alone," answered the poor fellow. "It's this and a hundred other things added on to it."Here he paused and gave me a quick glance of interrogation. After a moment he said, with a certain reluctance: —"Onslow says that you are awfully good-natured, Dr. Halifax.""I should be a brute if I took up the medical profession and were not good-natured to people in trouble," I replied."Well, that's just what I am: I'm in an awful state of perplexity. Onslow laughs at me; but, then, he's not a doctor. I'm convinced this is a case for a medical man. May I state it to you?""I shall be delighted to give you any advice in my power," I replied."It isn't about myself. It's about Frances. You know, of course, that we are engaged to be married? You have seen her — I think you sat next her last evening at dinner. Do you mind giving me your candid opinion about her?""She is a very pretty girl," I replied."Oh, yes, yes — I don't mean her appearance. If you were asked about her — her health, mental and physical, what would you say?""Nothing; for I know nothing.""I always thought doctors could see farther than most men," answered Oliver, almost with irritation. "I tell you what it is.: Frances, to 'all intents and purposes, is a dead woman, a statue cut in marble. She can move, she can speak, she can look lovely, she can eat — a little, not much — but she can no more love, she can no more feel than if she were really the marble I have likened her to. We have been engaged for six months; I have been away for over four. When I parted with her last she was Rosamond grown up. Think of Rosamond with her fire, her overflowing spirits, her vivacity. Is Frances like Rosamond now?""No," I said. "I have noticed the two sisters and observed the great contrast between them. The little one has a great deal of colour and her eyes are bright. Miss Wilton is deadly pale, and pretty as her eyes are, their expression is dull.""They usen't to have a dull expression," said Oliver. "Six months ago they had plenty of sparkle and life in them, and her cheeks were just like roses. But," continued the poor fellow, '' it is not the physical change that cuts me to the heart, it's the — the absence of all life; all — all affection; all interest in me and everything else. We are to be married in two months' time; Frances has not the least idea of breaking off our engagement. There's not a scrap of the flirt about her; but I might as well make a bride of a doll, or a bit of marble, for all the real interest she takes.""Was she excitable and affectionate when first you were engaged?" I inquired."Yes — yes — rather!’ He coloured as he spoke."Did you ever ask her if she felt ill?""Often. She says that she is in perfect health; but, oh! the apathy in her eyes! Sometimes, Dr. Halifax, I am inclined to fear that her mind is deranged.""I don't think there is the least occasion for you to alarm yourself on that score," I said. "Do you think Miss Wilton will see me as a medical man?""I am sure she won't. Nothing makes her so much annoyed as the faintest hint that she is not in perfect health.""She cannot maintain the position that she is in perfect health when she sends you off in a hurry for a certain medicine to the chemist. Look here. Captain Oliver, I'll take it upon myself to see her as soon as ever I go home. You may trust me to respect your confidence, and if there is anything really wrong, I think I can soon discover it."I had scarcely said these last words before the sound of hurrying feet caused us both to look up. Little Rosamond Wilton had come up the road to meet us."I came for the medicine," she panted. "Give it to me, Jim.""Unfortunately, I haven't got it," said Oliver."Not got it? What will poor Frances do?""I am ever so sorry, but it is her own fault. She forgot to send the prescription.""No, she didn't forget; she hadn't got the prescription. Collins has it. Oh, what an awful worry this is! What a stupid, stupid chemist! Frances wrote to him, and told him exactly what she wanted. He might have sent the medicine to her. Poor darling, she is nearly wild with misery now; and what will she do if there is any further delay? What a cruel chemist!""No, Rosamond, he is not cruel," I said. "The law forbids chemists to give certain drugs without proper prescriptions. The chemist could not have acted otherwise.""Then Frances will die!" exclaimed the child, stamping her little foot on the ground, and tears filling her bright brown eyes. " Frances will die. She can't go on suffering like this, it is quite impossible. You don't know. You can't guess. It is dreadful!""I can soon put your sister right," I said, in a confident tone. "Take me to her immediately.""You are a doctor, aren't you?" she inquired."Yes; the right person to see your sister if she is suffering.""But she won't have any doctor except Collins.""Who is Collins?""A nurse. She was with Frances once when she was ill. And now she always sends for her if she feels the least bit of anything the matter with her.""Well," I said, after a pause, "we are wasting time. Your sister is in pain. Collins is not here, and I am. Take me to her immediately.""Yes, Rosamond, do as you are told," said Oliver."She'll be angry; but I can't help it," murmured the child under her breath.She took my hand, and we went quickly to the house.In another moment I found myself in Miss Wilton's presence. I gave one glance at her face, and then told Rosamond to leave us. I knew what was the matter. The young girl was in the complete state of prostration caused by acute neurasthenia. Her respiration was hurried— she scarcely noticed me when I came into the room. She was lying on a sofa. I took her hand in mine and felt her pulse. It was beating one hundred and fifty times to the minute. Miss Wilton was very ill, and it was not difficult for me to ascertain the cause of this complete nervous prostration. I pushed up her sleeve and saw certain marks on her slightly wasted arm, which told me but too plainly that she was the victim of morphonism. The whole situation was now perfectly plain. Miss Wilton had suddenly come to the end of her supply of morphia, and was at present going through the awful storm of abstinence.I thought for a moment, and then made up my mind that, whatever the future consequences, there was only one thing to be done at present. I went to the bell and rang it sharply.A servant appeared in answer to my summons."Can you tell me if Mrs. Onslow is at home?" I asked."I don't know, sir; I'll inquire." "If she is in any of the sitting-rooms or about the grounds, send a footman to ask her to come to me immediately, to Miss Wilton's room."The servant withdrew, and in about ten minutes' time Mildred Onslow hastily appeared."What do you want with me?" she asked. Then as her eyes fell on Miss Wilton's prostrate form, she uttered a startled exclamation."What is the matter with poor, dear Frances? How frightfully ill she looks!""She is very ill," I replied, "but; I think I can soon relieve her. She is suffering from a most acute nervous attack, and I intend to inject a little morphia under the skin. That will quickly restore her to a more normal condition. Please stay with her, Mildred, while I fetch my bag of drugs and instruments."I rushed away, fetched a bottle of morphia and ^ a hypodermic syringe,and quickly injected a dose which contained one grain of morphine.The relief was almost instantaneous. Miss Wilton opened her eyes, gave a sigh of intense pleasure, and presently sat up. She was still bewildered, however, and scarcely recognised who were present."She is much better," I said to Mrs. Onslow, "but I should like her to keep very quiet for the rest of the day. Please send some soup or some other strong nourishment to her here. She will do best to stay in this room for to-day. Perhaps you will come and sit with her for a little in the afternoon. Now I want to have a short talk with my patient by herself"When I said this I noticed an uneasy glance in Miss Wilton's eyes, which showed me how rapidly she was returning to a convalescent stage."Need Mildred go away?" she asked. "I am much better now. You must have given me something to relieve that horrible, horrible pain.""Yes, I gave you a dose of morphia," I said."Ah, then, of course I am better," she remarked, with a sigh of relief."Yes," I said, " you may be able to have a nice sleep by-and-by, but there are one or two points I should like to talk over with you first. I shall not take up more than a moment or two of your time."Mildred left the room, and Miss Wilton seated herself with her back to the light."I may as well state frankly," I said at once, "that when I came into the room just now, your condition filled me with alarm. You were terribly weak, your respiration was hurried, your pulse quick. You had symptoms also of spinal exhaustion. I came to tell you that Captain Oliver had failed to get the medicine which you sent for.""Why failed?" she asked, in a quick, nervous voice."Because you had not sent a prescription. Chemists are forbidden by law to supply certain poisonous drugs without written instructions from a medical man. No such instructions accompanied your letter; therefore the medicine was not supplied.""Did you go with Jim to see the chemist? ""I walked with him to Market Lea.""And the— the— "Miss Wilton half rose from her chair, "the chemist showed you my letter?""No, the chemist was quite faithful to the trust you reposed in him."She sank back again on her seat, while an expression of intense relief swept over her young but worn face."Your little sister met us on our return home, and told us that you were in a state of suffering," I continued, "so I hastened to the rescue.""You are very kind," she replied, "and you have relieved my suffering for the time."She shuddered slightly as she spoke. She knew but too well how evanescent the small dose of morphia I had injected would be in its effects."It is tiresome about that prescription," she continued. "Nothing relieves me like that special medicine.""Then you are subject to these attacks?""Oc — occasionally." This word came out with great reluctance."Perhaps I could write you a prescription somewhat similar to the one you have lost?"She looked at me with intense eagerness. Then her eyes fell."No, thank you," she said. "My medicine partakes of the nature of a — a quack medicine. It suits me better than anything else. I think I'll send for a nurse who has often been of use to me. Her name is Collins. I should like to telegraph for her. That can be managed, can it not?""Certainly," I answered; "where does she live?""In London.""She cannot get to you before the evening," I answered. "And in the meantime you may have another attack. Of course, I am not prepared to say what causes them."Here I looked hard at her. She trembled and shrank from me. "I am not prepared to say what causes your attacks," I repeated; "but I have seen precisely similar ones occasioned by the abstinence from morphia in the victims of morphonism. A small dose of the poison invariably gives relief, as it did in your case. Only that it is quite impossible to imagine that you can be the victim of such a pernicious habit, I should say that you took morphia secretly.""As if that were likely," she stammered; "I — I hope — I should not do anything wicked of that sort.""It certainly is a very wicked habit," I replied, "and leads to the most disastrous results: the wreck of life in its fullest sense, the destruction of all the moral qualities. For instance, the morphia-maniac thinks nothing of telling lies, however truthful he may have been before he became the victim of this habit. Well, I will leave you now, as you look inclined to sleep, and sleep will be beneficial to you. If you feel a return of the painful symptoms which prostrated you this morning, send for me, and I will inject a little more morphia.""Oh, thank you," she answered, with a look of gratitude. And now she prepared to settle herself comfortably on the sofa."You won't forget to telegraph for Collins?" she said, as I was leaving the room."You must give me her address," I answered.She supplied me with it, and I left her.I must confess that I felt much puzzled how to act. Miss Wilton was a morphiamaniac. Her flimsy half denial of the fact was but in keeping with her disease. Should I tell the truth to poor Oliver?I thought over the circumstances of the case briefly, and then resolved to take Mildred Onslow into my confidence. I saw her alone immediately after lunch, and told her what I had discovered."How dreadful!" she exclaimed, when I had finished my short story. "It seems almost impossible to believe that Frances, of all people, could he addicted to such a vice, and yet you said you saw the marks on her arm?""I did, but even without that evidence all the other symptoms point to the same conclusion.""But what can be her motive?" said Mildred. "Six months ago there could not have been a brighter, dearer girl in existence. She was so happy in her engagement too; in short, she was the very personification of perfect health, happiness, and all the graces which adorn young womanhood.""You cannot say that she is the personification of these things now," I replied."No; she is much changed — Jim notices it — he is very unhappy. Oh, poor Frances! Is there any chance of her being cured?""Yes, if she will help herself. She is particularly weak, however. I seldom saw anyone as young so completely under the influence of the drug. I could not counsel complete abstinence from it at the present moment, and I intend to inject morphia again to-night. We have now, however, to decide immediately on two things: is the nurse Collins to be telegraphed for, and is Captain Oliver to be told?"Before Mildred could reply, the door of the room where we were talking was abruptly opened and Oliver himself, looking perturbed and heated, came in."I saw you two talking through the window," he said, "and could not restrain my impatience. I know you are discussing Frances's condition, and perhaps you are intending to conceal some particulars from me. Now, I insist upon knowing the truth immediately."Mildred coloured and hesitated.''Dr. Halifax and I were just wondering whether we ought to send for a nurse of the name of Collins," she began."Collins," repeated Oliver, abruptly. He laughed in a somewhat harsh manner. "Rosamond and I telegraphed for Collins half an hour ago," he said. "What is the use of hesitating about a natural wish of that sort? I suppose a sick girl may be at liberty to send for the nurse she fancies?" " Certainly," I replied. "And now I want the truth," he continued. "What is the matter with Frances?" Before I could reply, Mildred came suddenly up to me. There was an imploring look on her face. She did not speak, however, and the next moment hastily left the room.I looked at Oliver. He was startlingly white round his eyes and lips."You know what ails Miss Wilton," he began. " For God's sake, whatever it is, don't make a mystery of it. I can bear the truth, whatever it is. Is she dying?" "Almost as bad," I murmured to myself. Aloud I said, "Nothing of the sort. You want the truth, so you must have it. I warn you in advance that it is startling and painful. Miss Wilton is a confirmed morphia-maniac." "Nonsense," said Oliver. He looked as if he would much like to knock me down. I walked to the window before I replied."I told you that the truth would be painful. That is it. That simple fact accounts for the change which you spoke to me of. I have seen such things before, but never, never, in one so young, so apparently healthy and happy. I had my suspicions even while you were speaking to me, but when I saw the young lady, all doubts were solved immediately.""What were her symptoms?""Those which invariably arise when the unhappy victim is from any cause deprived of the accustomed stimulant. The larger the quantity of morphia taken, the greater is the distress when it is done without. When I came to Miss Wilton, she was almost in extremis. This fact shows that she has been accustomed to injecting large doses.""Injecting!""Yes, with a hypodermic syringe. There are many marks on her arm.""Did you do anything for her relief?""Yes, the only thing. I gave her more morphia.""Why?""I will tell you why presently, immediately to decide on now is: what is to be done when this nurse arrives? I must say plainly I am sorry you telegraphed for her."Oliver was about to reply when I interrupted him."I suspect the nurse," I continued, "but forewarned is forearmed. As soon as ever she comes, I shall have an interview with her, and tax her with what I feel is the truth. In the meantime, I shall consider Miss Wilton my patient, and as I have begun to prescribe for her will go on doing so. And now. Captain Oliver, your part is to look cheerful and to pretend to know nothing. I want you to go and sit with Miss Wilton for a short time this afternoon. If she confides in you, well and good. She may possibly do so, for she has had a good fright, I can assure you; but if she does not, you must treat her as if you knew nothing. Remember.""Oh, yes, I'll remember," said Oliver. His face worked; I saw that he was struggling with emotion, and left him.At six o'clock that evening Collins arrived. I saw her before she was admitted to Miss Wilton's presence; she was a thin, refined looking woman, neatly dressed, and with an almost lady-like manner and appearance. Her face was sharp and pale; she had light, thin, auburn hair, and very pale-blue eyes with white eyelashes. I took a dislike to her on the spot."I wish to see you," I began, "to tell you I have discovered what ails Miss Wilton. She is a morphia-maniac of a most confirmed type."The nurse started when I said this. I saw denial on her lips, but she quickly took her cue, and spoke in a deprecating tone."Ah!" she said, "that fact is no news to me. Poor dear! How often have I begged of her not to get under the influence of this pernicious drug.""Your entreaties have been quite without effect," I replied. "I am glad, however, that you are fully awake to the danger Miss Wilton runs. The victims of morphonism go through many phases — Miss Wilton is rapidly approaching that of direct poisoning, and if the drug is freely administered now, she will undoubtedly die. I say this to warn you, on no account whatever, to inject morphia. I am her medical man, and I will give it her myself when necessary. Have you a hypodermic syringe and morphia with you?" My question was so direct that the woman coloured and stammered."I always carry these things about with me," she said, more truthfully than I expected. "No one can ever tell, in a profession like mine, when they may be required.""That is quite true," I replied; "but under the present circumstances I should be glad if you would give both the morphia and the syringe to me. Thus, if your patient begs of you to administer the drug, it will be out of your power to yield to her entreaties."She looked at me hard when I said this, and then, opening a hand-bag, she gave me a small bottle containing some of the dangerous fluid, and a little case which held the syringe.After putting a few more questions, during which I elicited the information that Nurse Collins had been trained at Guy's Hospital, I took her myself to Miss Wilton's room.There was no mistaking the look of relief which spread itself over the young girl's face when she saw her."Oh, nurse, you have come!" she exclaimed, and, tottering forward, she flung herself into the woman's arms.I closed the door softly behind me. I felt more uneasy than I cared to own. It is true I had secured the syringe and the morphia, but the nurse might find means of supplying herself with more morphia, and, of course, Frances must have a syringe of her own.I had administered my first dose of morphia to Miss Wilton at noon. As I expected, she sent for me to ask for another injection between four and five. This was shortly before the nurse arrived. If Nurse Collins had really no morphia in her possession, my services would be probably required between ten and eleven that night. I little guessed, however, what was really to occur.A large party of friends were coming to dine at Holmwood that evening. The dinner was to be followed by a dance, to which all the young people of the neighbourhood were invited. I, as one of the guests staying in the house, had, of course, to be present. I held myself in readiness, however, to go to my patient whenever the summons came.Little Rosamond had begged hard to be allowed to sit up for the dance."I don't want to stay with Frances now that horrid Collins has come," was her frank remark.Miss Rosamond was sufficiently spoiled to have her way, and Jim in particular took her under his special patronage.I was standing near one of the doorways watching these two as they threaded the giddy mazes of the waltz. I was inwardly feeling a good deal of uneasiness at not being summoned to Miss Wilton, for the hour was now long past that when she ought to require a fresh dose of her stimulant, when I was suddenly attracted by a look of astonishment on Rosamond's bright face. She was gazing past me towards another door further down the ball-room.I turned in the direction of her glance, and saw to my amazement Frances, beautifully dressed, the flash of diamonds in her hair and round her white throat, advancing into the room.I went up to her at once. She looked slightly, but only slightly, annoyed when she saw me."I'm all right now," she said, in a cheerful tone. "I have quite recovered. I told you, Dr. Halifax, that I only needed my own special quack medicine and Collins's aid to restore me."I could scarcely reply to her. She swept past me to speak to an acquaintance. She looked brilliant, and was unquestionably the most beautiful girl in the room. Her fine dark eyes, generally so dull in expression, were now bright and sparkling. There was not the least doubt that she was under the influence of a powerful dose of the poison.I hastily left the ball-room and went upstairs to find Nurse Collins.She was not in Miss Wilton's sitting-room. I rang a bell, and asked the servant to send her to me."Do you mean the nurse from London, sir?" inquired the maid. "She isn't here. Miss Wilton ordered a carriage for her, and she went away about an hour ago."I felt too astonished to speak for a moment."I was not aware of this," I said, after a pause.I quickly returned to the ball-room. Frances was now dancing with Oliver, who looked in the highest spirits, and Rosamond ran up to my side. ^"Do waltz with me. Dr. Halifax," she asked.I took her little hand and led her into the midst of the dancers.As we were revolving round and round, I asked her a few questions."Do you know, Rosamond, that your bite noir, Collins, has gone?""No," she replied, in a tone that did not express much surprise. "But she doesn't often stay long. I suppose she has filled up all Frances's bottles with the quack medicine.""But that quack medicine is very bad for your sister.""I don't think so. She can't live without it. Doesn't she look lovely? Isn't she beautiful girl?""Yes," I replied, briefly."And don't her diamonds flash? Don't you love diamonds, Dr. Halifax?""Yes, but not on such young girls as your sister.""Frances always likes to wear diamonds; she doesn't mind whether her taste is peculiar or not. Let's come a little nearer to her, I want to be sure of something. Yes, just as I thought. She hasn't on her pendant, now."The note was from Rosamond, a childish production, and very short."Dear Dr. Halifax," she wrote, "I'm awfully unhappy, so I must just send you this letter. Frances has quarrelled with Collins, who won't do what she wants. We are both going away, and no one is to know where we are going to – I don’t know myself, so I can’t tell you. Frances says that you are a horrid man; she says you have accused her of doing dreadful, wicked things. I don’t believe you are a horrid man. I like you very much, and I am very unhappy about going away. – Rosamond.”After reading the little note I gave it to Mildred. She glanced her eyes quickly over it, then threw it, with a gesture of despair, on the table."Now, what is to be done?" she exclaimed. " Frances and Rosamond have disappeared. No one knows where they have gone. Frances was very ill yesterday. If what you say is true, it is extremely unsafe for her to be left to her own devices.""It is more than unsafe," I replied. "Miss Wilton is in a condition when she ought not to be left for a single moment without a responsible person to look after her. Surely it can't be difficult to trace the sisters? Surely they can be followed at once?""Of course they can," said Onslow. "You always go to the fair about things, my love," he continued, turning to his wife. "A pair of children like Frances and Rosamond cannot lose themselves in these nineteenth century days. We can soon track them, and if we have a doctor's authority for taking such a step, it shall be done immediately.""Ought not Oliver to be consulted?" I said."I'll go and fetch him," said Onslow.He left the room and returned in a few moments, accompanied by Jim Oliver. The young soldier was quite alive to the difficulties of our position. The nervous distress, which yesterday so completely overpowered him, had now vanished.He was intensely anxious, but he did not show undue agitation. We had a brief consultation, and then it was arranged that I should go back immediately to London and try to learn everything there was to be known about Nurse Collins. I had elicited one apparent fact from her yesterday, viz., that she had been trained as a nurse at Guy's Hospital. Accordingly, on the afternoon of that same day, I went to the hospital and set inquiries on foot with regard to her. The books were searched, and it was soon abundantly proved that no nurse of the name of Collins had ever been trained at that hospital."Then," I exclaimed, "the woman is not even a medical nurse. If she is really still with that poor girl, her wretched victim may be dead before we can rescue her."The matron to whom I was speaking became interested, and presently asked me to describe the supposed nurse's appearance.I did so, minutely."Light auburn hair," quoted the matron, "very light blue eyes and white eyelashes — a thin face. How old should you say the woman was. Dr. Halifax?""From five-and-twenty to thirty," I replied."About the middle height?""Yes, a slight person.""Did she walk with the faintest suspicion of a limp — so very slight that it might be passed over without comment?"Now it so happened that Nurse Collins did walk with a sort of swing, which had arrested my attention when I took her to my patient the evening before."I could scarcely call it a limp," I said, "but it is certainly true that the nurse's walk was a little peculiar.""Then I know who she is," said the matron; "that description could scarcely fit two people. She was trained here, but not under the name of Collins. See — I will show you her name in the book. Nurse Cray — twenty-three years of age — auburn hair, light blue eyes, very slight limp. That nurse. Dr. Halifax, stayed with us exactly a year. She was an admirable and clever nurse. She left at the end of that time under peculiar circumstances.""Do you mind telling me what they were?"The matron hesitated."I don't wish to injure anyone," she said, after a pause; "but in this case it is right for you to have all possible information. Nurse Cray left here on suspicion of theft. A large sum of money had been left in her charge by a lady patient. This is quite an exceptional thing to do. When the lady was leaving, the money was not forthcoming. Nurse declared it had been stolen from her. The lady was not willing to prosecute, and the matter was dropped. But Cray left the next week, and we have not heard anything of her since. I believe her to be a dangerous woman, and I should be sorry to have any girl in her power."This information I imparted in due course to my friends at Holmwood. In the meantime Onslow and Captain Oliver were leaving not a stone unturned to trace the two girls. The end of the second day arrived, however, without our having obtained the slightest clue to their whereabouts.Poor Oliver was nearly wild with anxiety, and my own fears were very grave. I could not get Frances Wilton's face out of my mind. I saw it in my mind's eye, wherever I turned, or whatever I did. I wondered what the wretched girl's ultimate fate would be. There was little doubt that she was quickly reaching that stage when direct morphia' poisoning begins. If she were really still in Collins's power, her days on earth were numbered.Sitting by my fireside on the evening of the second day I thought of her with increased uneasiness. It was almost impossible to believe that two rather remarkable looking girls like Frances and Rosamond could disappear as it were bodily from the earth. Onslow and Oliver were both clever and keen-sighted men. We were employing the best private detective we knew to assist us, and yet up to the present we had not got the slightest clue to the whereabouts of the girls. I felt so anxious as I pondered over these things that I felt inclined to run down to Holmwood by the last train that evening. Before this thought, however, had taken the form of a resolution, there came a ring to my hall door, and the next moment my servant told me that a woman was waiting to see me."What is her name?" I asked."She refuses to give it, sir," replied the man. "She says she will not keep you long, but she earnestly begs of you to let her see you without delay.""Show her into the consulting-room," I said.
