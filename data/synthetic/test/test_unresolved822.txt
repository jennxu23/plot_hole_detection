Private detective Hewitt sat at his desk, the events of the past week racing through his mind. He had successfully thwarted an Anarchist plot in London, but one mystery still lingered—the case of Gérard, the Frenchman who had lost his ability to communicate due to aphasia. Hewitt knew there was more to Gérard's story than met the eye, and he was determined to unravel it.Hewitt poured over Gérard's sketches and scribbles, trying to decipher the meaning behind the seemingly random lines and shapes. With each stroke of Gérard's pen, Hewitt felt himself getting closer to the truth. His assistant, a keen-eyed young woman named Charlotte, observed silently from across the room, occasionally offering a fresh perspective that sparked new ideas in Hewitt's mind.As Hewitt studied one of Gérard's sketches—a rough drawing of what appeared to be a horse-shoe—he suddenly had a realization. The horse-shoe was a clue, a symbol that led him to a particular location in London. With a sense of urgency, Hewitt gathered his things and motioned for Charlotte to follow. They set off through the bustling streets of London, following the trail laid out by Gérard's sketches.Their journey led them to a stable yard on the outskirts of the city. As they approached, Hewitt's keen eyes spotted a basket-cowl on a chimney, just as Gérard had sketched. The pieces were falling into place, and Hewitt knew they were on the right track. They cautiously entered the stable yard, where they found rows of loaves of bread stacked neatly on a shelf.Hewitt's heart raced as he inspected the loaves, his intuition telling him that danger lurked within. Carefully, he examined each loaf, feeling for any signs of tampering. With a steady hand, he cut open one of the loaves and his suspicions were confirmed—hidden inside was a dangerous explosive device.
