It involved Lieutenant Bridewell, whose father, Captain Bridewell, was suffering from a mysterious illness that was slowly deteriorating his health. Concerned for her friend and his family, Ailsa implored Cleek to come to their aid.Upon arriving in Devonshire, Cleek was greeted by Ailsa, who led him to the Bridewell estate. The atmosphere was heavy with worry and tension as they entered the grand old house. Ailsa explained that Captain Bridewell's condition had been baffling the local physicians, and Lieutenant Bridewell was desperate for answers.Cleek wasted no time in getting to work. He observed the family dynamics, the layout of the house, and the behavior of the staff. It wasn't long before he sensed that something sinister lurked beneath the surface. Ailsa confided in Cleek about her suspicions regarding Dr. Fordyce, the family physician, and Colonel Goshen, a close family friend.As Cleek delved deeper into his investigation, he discovered a diabolical plot orchestrated by Dr. Fordyce and Colonel Goshen. They were working together to destroy evidence that would expose the Tackbun Claimant as an imposter. The claimant was an individual who was laying false claim to a significant inheritance, and the tattooed mark on Captain Bridewell's arm held the key to proving his fraudulent identity.
