The murder of Mr. Culledon had sent shockwaves through the streets of London. The wealthy businessman had been found dead in his study, a single gunshot wound to the head. The police were baffled, unable to find any leads or suspects. It was then that Lady Molly Robertson-Kirk, renowned for her astute observations and deductive reasoning, was called upon to investigate the case.Lady Molly, accompanied by her trusted assistant, William, arrived at the Culledon estate to begin their investigation. As they were shown into the study where the murder had taken place, Lady Molly's keen eyes took in every detail of the room. She noted the position of the body, the placement of the furniture, and the faint scent of a particular perfume lingering in the air.Lady Molly turned to Lady Irene Culledon, the grieving widow, who sat pale and composed in a corner of the room. "Tell me, Lady Culledon, what were the circumstances surrounding your husband's death?" Lady Molly asked calmly.Lady Irene's voice wavered slightly as she recounted the events of the evening. She claimed that she had been in the drawing room reading when she heard a gunshot ring out. Rushing to her husband's study, she had discovered his lifeless body slumped over his desk.Lady Molly listened intently, her sharp mind already piecing together the fragments of information. She observed Lady Irene's demeanor closely, noting the flicker of something akin to fear in her eyes when she spoke of the gunshot.As Lady Molly and William began to examine the room for clues, they came across a distinctive hat lying haphazardly on a nearby chair. Lady Molly's eyes widened in recognition, and she quickly picked up the hat, her fingers tracing the intricate embroidery along the brim."Whose hat is this, Lady Culledon?" Lady Molly inquired, holding up the hat for all to see.Lady Irene's face paled visibly, her eyes widening in surprise. "That... that is mine," she stammered, her voice trembling.Lady Molly's lips curled into a knowing smile. "And yet, Lady Culledon, this hat was found near your husband's body, not on your own head. Care to explain how it ended up here?"
