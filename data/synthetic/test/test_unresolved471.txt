Lady Violet Dalrymple woke up in her bed, the early morning light filtering through the curtains. Her head felt heavy, memories of a fevered delirium floating at the edge of her consciousness. She sat up slowly, her hand instinctively going to her neck, feeling a strange weight there. As her fingers brushed against cool jewels, she looked down in surprise to see the familiar shimmer of the Ponsonby diamonds adorning her throat.Confusion clouded her mind as she tried to piece together the events of the past few days. She remembered feeling unwell, her engagement to Captain Ponsonby, and then a blur of dreams and nightmares. But how had the diamonds come back to her possession? And why did she feel a sense of peace and comfort when she looked at them now?Lady Violet's mother, Lady Erstfield, entered the room at that moment, her face a mix of relief and concern. "My dear Violet, you're awake. How do you feel?"Lady Violet blinked, trying to gather her thoughts. "Mother, what happened? How did the diamonds come back to me?"Lady Erstfield hesitated for a moment before sitting down on the edge of the bed.
