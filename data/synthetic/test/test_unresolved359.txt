Martin Hewitt, the renowned detective, received a call late one evening summoning him to the scene of a crime. As he arrived at the home of the deceased, Foggatt, he was met with a grim sight—Foggatt lay slumped in his sitting room, a gunshot wound to his chest. The room was in disarray, with overturned furniture and a shattered vase adding to the chaos.Hewitt's keen eye immediately began to assess the scene. He noted the angle of the bullet hole, the position of the furniture, and the faint smell of gunpowder lingering in the air. As he meticulously examined each detail, a picture began to form in his mind.Through his observations, Hewitt deduced that the shooter must have been tall and agile, based on the trajectory of the bullet and the lack of forced entry into the room. He also noticed a half-eaten apple on the table, a detail that seemed inconsequential at first but would later prove crucial to the case.As the investigation progressed, Hewitt interviewed witnesses and gathered information about Foggatt's past. It was revealed that Foggatt had a reputation for being a ruthless businessman, known to ruin lives in his pursuit of wealth. Hewitt sensed a motive rooted in revenge, and his suspicions turned towards a young man named Sidney Mason.Mason, a solicitor by profession, was described as tall and athletic—a former gymnast or perhaps a sailor. His physical attributes matched Hewitt's profile of the potential culprit. Digging deeper, Hewitt uncovered a connection between Mason's parents and Foggatt, revealing a dark history of betrayal and deceit.Through a series of clever deductions and strategic maneuvers, Hewitt tracked Mason's movements and eventually cornered him. However, before Hewitt could apprehend him, Mason managed to slip away, leaving behind only a cryptic letter addressed to the detective.
