In the small town of Oakvale, Rufus and his uncle Abner were known as trustworthy men who always took care of their community. One sunny afternoon, they set out to check on the cattle grazing on the pastureland that once belonged to the ruined sheriff, Asbury Smallwood. As they rode through the rolling hills, Abner's keen eyes noticed some suspicious horse tracks leading off the main trail. Curious, he decided to follow them, with Rufus following close behind.The tracks led them deep into the dense woods, where they stumbled upon a worn-out horse tied to a tree, its saddlebags filled with coins and bills. Abner's eyes narrowed in suspicion as he realized the horse belonged to the disgraced sheriff, Asbury Smallwood. It was well-known in Oakvale that Smallwood had been involved in some shady dealings before his downfall, but no one had suspected him of stealing from his own father's grave.Abner's sense of justice flared up as he realized the extent of Smallwood's deceit. He knew he had to confront the former sheriff and bring his misdeeds to light. They rode back to town, the weight of their discovery heavy on their shoulders.That evening, Abner went to Smallwood's house and demanded to speak with him. Smallwood tried to deny any wrongdoing, but Abner's unwavering gaze pierced through his lies. With a heavy heart, Smallwood finally confessed to his secret visits to his father's grave, where he had hidden the money he had stolen from the town's coffers.
