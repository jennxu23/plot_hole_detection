It was a rainy Tuesday afternoon when F. Graham Dixon hurried into Hewitt's office, a look of distress etched across his face. The engineer was a man of precision and order, his sharp eyes reflecting the turmoil within him."Hewitt, I need your help," Dixon said, his voice laced with urgency.Hewitt, a seasoned detective known for his keen observation skills and quick thinking, leaned forward in his chair, his eyes locking onto Dixon's."Tell me what has happened," Hewitt said, his voice calm and steady.Dixon went on to explain how the top-secret design for a revolutionary torpedo had been stolen from his office. The implications of such a theft were grave, not only for Dixon's reputation but for the safety and security of the nation.Hewitt listened intently, his mind already racing through the possibilities. He asked detailed questions, probing for any clues or inconsistencies in Dixon's account. After a thorough discussion, Hewitt concluded that the theft was an inside job.Dixon's face paled at the suggestion. "But my assistants are all loyal and trustworthy," he protested.Hewitt, however, remained unfazed. He requested a list of all the employees who had access to the design and began his investigation. His first suspect was Ritter, one of Dixon's longtime assistants. There was something in Ritter's demeanor, a subtle shift in his gaze when questioned, that set off alarm bells in Hewitt's mind.To confirm his suspicions, Hewitt devised a clever ruse. He pretended to accidentally leave his walking stick behind in Dixon's office, knowing that Ritter would be the one to find it. The walking stick contained hidden compartments, and inside one of them was a note detailing a meeting between Ritter and a mysterious figure named Mirsky.Sure enough, Ritter took the bait.
