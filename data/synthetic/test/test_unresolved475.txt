However, as Hewitt meticulously examined the evidence, he began to question the narrative that had been woven around the case. The footprints in the wood told a different story—one of a desperate man driven to his end by circumstances beyond his control.As Hewitt and Brett followed the trail of clues, they stumbled upon a foreign gipsy camp on the outskirts of the village.
