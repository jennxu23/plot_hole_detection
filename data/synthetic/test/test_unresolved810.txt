Dr. Stewart sat back in his study, the fading sunlight casting a warm glow over the room as he recounted the events that had unfolded in the past few days. The tale he had to tell was one of deceit, redemption, and ultimately, reconciliation.It all began with Major-General Sir Anthony Collingswood accusing his nephew, Alan, of cheating him in the sale of a valuable diamond. The accusation had torn apart the once-close family, leaving a bitter rift between uncle and nephew. Alan vehemently denied the allegations, but Sir Anthony was adamant in his belief that he had been deceived.Desperate to uncover the truth and mend the broken family ties, Dr. Stewart enlisted the help of Dora Myrl, a young woman known for her astute mind and resourcefulness. Together, they devised a plan to orchestrate a final meeting with the diamond merchant, Mr. Solomons, in the hopes of unraveling the mystery surrounding the diamond.As they gathered in Mr. Solomons' office, tensions ran high. Sir Anthony's steely gaze bore down on Alan, who remained resolute in his innocence. Dr. Stewart observed the proceedings carefully, his mind working overtime to piece together the puzzle.It was Dora's quick thinking and keen observation that ultimately exposed the truth. As the diamond was weighed and measured, Dora noticed a subtle discrepancy that had gone unnoticed by everyone else in the room.
