It was a foggy evening in London, and the gas lamps cast a dim glow on the cobbled streets as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson made their way to the residence of Professor Presbury. The esteemed professor had been exhibiting increasingly erratic behavior, alarming his colleagues and family with his sudden mood swings and strange outbursts.As they entered the dimly lit study of Professor Presbury, Holmes observed the disarray of the room and noted the scattered papers and overturned furniture. The professor himself sat slumped in his chair, his eyes glazed over and his hands trembling. His daughter, Agnes, stood nearby, her face etched with worry and fear.Holmes wasted no time in assessing the situation. He approached the professor and began to ask probing questions, trying to unravel the mystery behind his sudden change in demeanor. As he delved deeper into the professor's recent activities and contacts, a name caught his attention - Dr. Lowenstein, a scientist from Prague known for his groundbreaking research in biochemistry.Upon further investigation, Holmes discovered that Professor Presbury had been experimenting with a serum provided by Dr. Lowenstein, purported to enhance cognitive abilities and memory retention. However, the serum had unforeseen side effects, leading to the professor's erratic behavior and loss of control over his emotions.
