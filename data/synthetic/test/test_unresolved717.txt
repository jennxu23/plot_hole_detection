It was a damp and foggy morning in London when Miss Violet Hunter arrived at 221B Baker Street, seeking the assistance of the renowned detective, Sherlock Holmes. She was a young woman of striking appearance, with a determined look in her eyes as she recounted her peculiar tale to Holmes and Dr. John Watson.Miss Hunter explained that she had recently been offered a position as a governess at a remote country estate called the Copper Beeches. The offer came from a wealthy man named Mr. Rucastle, who lived there with his wife and daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle. The terms of the employment were unusually generous, but Miss Hunter felt that something was amiss and sought Holmes' expertise to uncover the truth.
