The legend spoke of a beautiful but sinister woman named Lola Tepeaca, who was rumored to be in possession of the skull and used its dark magic for her own gain.Harry, always the more daring of the two, was immediately drawn to the allure of the turquoise skull and the enigmatic Lola.

He could sense the malevolent energy emanating from the turquoise skull and the dangerous influence it held over his brother. But Harry was blind to the danger, captivated by Lola's beauty and the promise of power that the skull offered.One fateful night, Frank's worst fears were realized when he discovered Harry's lifeless body in a deserted alley, his eyes wide with terror and the turquoise skull clutched in his hand.
