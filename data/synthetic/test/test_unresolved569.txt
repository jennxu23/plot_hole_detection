Dora sat in her modest sitting room, the ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece the only sound in the room. She absentmindedly sipped her tea, her thoughts drifting until the shrill ring of the telephone cut through the silence. With a start, she picked up the receiver."Hello?" she answered."Dora, it's Pussie," came the urgent voice on the other end of the line."Pussie, what's the matter? You sound distressed," Dora replied, concern evident in her tone."It's a nightmare, Dora. Honor has been arrested for the murder of Mrs. Phillimore. I don't believe she did it, but the evidence is stacked against her," Pussie explained, her voice trembling with emotion.Dora's heart sank at the news. Honor, the kind and devoted nurse to Pussie's guardian, Dr. Phillimore, was like a sister to Pussie. Dora knew she had to act swiftly to uncover the truth and save Honor from a wrongful conviction."I'll be on the next train to your estate, Pussie. We'll get to the bottom of this together," Dora promised before hanging up the phone.Upon her arrival at the grand Phillimore estate, Dora was greeted by a distraught Pussie. The mansion felt eerie, shrouded in mystery and tension. Pussie led Dora to the drawing-room where they found Dr. Phillimore, a distinguished gentleman with a cold demeanor."Dora, thank you for coming. It's a terrible situation, but I believe in Honor's innocence," Dr. Phillimore stated, his voice smooth but lacking genuine emotion.Dora observed the interactions between Dr. Phillimore and Honor's lawyer, Mr. Thompson, as they discussed the case. Something felt off, and Dora's instincts told her there was more to the story than met the eye.Intrigued and determined to unravel the truth, Dora sought out Madame Celestine, the renowned palmist known for her uncanny ability to reveal hidden secrets. Madame Celestine lived on the outskirts of town in a charming cottage adorned with mystical symbols and flickering candles.As Dora entered the dimly lit parlor, Madame Celestine greeted her with a knowing smile. Dora explained the situation with Honor and the suspicious circumstances surrounding Mrs. Phillimore's death. Madame Celestine listened intently, her piercing gaze seeming to look beyond the physical into the realm of the unseen.After examining Dora's palm, Madame Celestine's expression turned grave.
