Professor Kennedy sat in his study, surrounded by stacks of books and papers, his sharp mind already at work on the next challenge that awaited him. As a renowned detective and criminologist, he was used to receiving cases that pushed the limits of his intellect and reasoning. Yet, when a distraught Agatha Seabury burst into his office that fateful morning, he knew he was about to embark on a journey unlike any other."Professor Kennedy, please, you must help me," Agatha pleaded, her eyes filled with desperation.Kennedy motioned for her to sit down and compose herself before explaining the reason for her distress. Agatha shared with him the contents of a menacing letter she had received from a certain H. Morgan Sherburne, accusing her of a crime she did not commit and demanding a large sum of money to keep the scandal quiet. Agatha was a respected member of society, and the mere thought of such an accusation tarnishing her reputation was unbearable.Kennedy listened intently, his mind already working out the various angles of the case. He assured Agatha that he would do everything in his power to uncover the truth and clear her name.As Kennedy delved into the investigation, he discovered a complex web of deceit and suspicion surrounding the Seabury family. Agatha's husband, Judson Seabury, harbored his own fears of being poisoned, convinced that someone was trying to harm him. Kennedy's curiosity was piqued, and he decided to conduct a groundbreaking medical test on Judson to determine the validity of his suspicions.
