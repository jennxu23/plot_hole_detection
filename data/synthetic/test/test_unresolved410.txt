Kennedy sat in his office, flipping through some case files, when his phone rang. It was Stevenson Williams from Continental Surety company, a man Kennedy had worked with on previous cases."Good afternoon, Mr. Williams. How can I help you today?" Kennedy greeted him."Professor Kennedy, we have a complex case involving forgery, theft, and morphine addiction that we need your expertise on," Williams explained, his voice filled with urgency.Intrigued by the nature of the case, Kennedy agreed to meet with Williams at his office later in the day. As they sat down to discuss the details, Williams explained that the By-Products Company had discovered discrepancies in their financial records that pointed towards forgery and embezzlement. The bank where the company held its accounts had also reported suspicious transactions.Kennedy and his team immediately started their investigation, poring over financial documents, interviewing employees, and examining bank records. As they delved deeper into the case, they discovered a pattern of forged signatures on checks and falsified invoices that had been used to siphon off funds from the company.One name kept coming up in their investigation - John Carroll, a high-ranking officer at the By-Products Company. Subtle clues and inconsistencies in the financial records led Kennedy to suspect Carroll's involvement in the crimes.To gather more evidence and confirm their suspicions, Kennedy decided to utilize a telelectrograph, a cutting-edge technology that allowed images to be transmitted over long distances. With the help of his team, Kennedy managed to obtain a photograph from a recent trip Carroll had taken to Atlantic City.The telelectrograph hummed to life as the image slowly materialized on the screen. Kennedy's keen eyes scanned the photo, and he noticed something peculiar - a distinctive birthmark on Carroll's hand that matched the forged signatures on the company's documents.
