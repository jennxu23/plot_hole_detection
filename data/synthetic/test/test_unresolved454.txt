Martin Hewitt, a renowned detective known for his sharp intellect and keen investigative skills, found himself intrigued by the peculiar case of the murder of a man named Rameau in a building near the National Gallery. Rameau, a loud and troublesome tenant, had been found dead with a severe head wound, but what baffled everyone was the mysterious disappearance of his body shortly after it was discovered.The main suspect in the case was Victor Goujon, a Frenchman who had a known grudge against Rameau. Goujon had been seen arguing with the victim on multiple occasions, and his animosity towards Rameau was evident to everyone in the building. The police were convinced that Goujon was responsible for the murder, especially after witnesses claimed to have seen him leaving the building around the time of the crime.
