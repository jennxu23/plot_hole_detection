“MR. SPEAKER, sir,” said Mr. Mirabel, M.P., rising and raising his hat, “I beg to ask the Right Honourable the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as head of the Mint, the questions that stand in my name.”These are the questions that stood in his name:—1. “Is the Right Hon. gentleman aware that there is a large and increasing quantity of unauthorised imitations of the silver coins of the realm in circulation in the United Kingdom?”2. “What steps, if any, have been taken to detect the coiner or coiners and withdraw such counterfeit coin from circulation?”3. “Is it true that these counterfeit coins are made from pure silver, and in view of this circumstance are the Government prepared to consider the adoption of the principle of bimetallism and free coinage of silver as the only effective preventive?”Sir Robert Verdon, the handsome and portly Chancellor of the Exchequer, was plainly nettled by the questions. He showed no trace of his customary good-humour as he rose to reply.“Her Majesty’s Government,” he said, “have had their attention directed to the circumstances mentioned in the question of my honourable friend. They are taking active measures for the detection of the offender and the suppression of the offence. But it would not be for the interest of the public service to enter into further detail. In reply to the last paragraph of the question of my honourable friend, the Government are not prepared to propose bimetallism as the alternative to crime.”There was a ripple of laughter below the gangway at the close of the answer; but the men on the front benches did not join in it. The matter under consideration was too serious. It was well known that a vast system of silver coinage, in which the Mint had no concern, was in process for the last three or four years. It was rumoured that the system had, by some mysterious process, extended over the Continent and even to America. But, as it subsequently transpired, even the initiated had but a faint conception of the extent of this gigantic fraud.About five years before, the persistent slump in silver had brought its price down to under two-and-six per ounce. The intrinsic value of the metal of the silver coins of the United Kingdom was therefore not quite half the face value guaranteed by the Government; in other words, there was less than sixpence worth of silver in a shilling, and so on with the rest.This slump had, of course, the effect amongst silver owners of intensifying the outcry for bimetallism.But it had another effect more serious. The bright notion struck some enterprising coiner to make false coin in pure silver. The cost of the metal was less than half the value of the coin, and as his workmanship and material were as good as the Mint, detection of the counterfeit was impossible.The idea caught on and grew to a vast international system. The counterfeit silver coins slipped mysteriously into general circulation. No one questioned them—no one could question them. To call them “base coin” would be a clear misnomer. They differed from the genuine coinage only in their place of origin. So vast was the system that the increase of silver coinage and the consequent demand for the metal began to tell on the price of silver bullion. It rose gradually from half-a-crown to four shillings per ounce, though the rise was popularly attributed to other causes. Even financial experts never guessed how largely it was due to this practically free coinage of silver.No wonder the Chancellor of the Exchequer was annoyed when Mr. Mirabel inconsiderately directed the attention of the House of Commons, and worse still, of the public, to this highly inconvenient and embarrassing question. All the same, he began to regret his curtness, after a bit. Mr. Mirabel, the millionaire banker, was one of the wealthiest, the most generous, the most hospitable, and the most popular man in the House of Commons. He seldom spoke, but always to the purpose, yet without that affectation of superior knowledge which is so irritating to the ignorant. He was a sound Liberal, and his vote and cheque-book were always at the service of the party. To crown all, he was an intimate personal friend of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.On the other hand, Mr. Mirabel did not seem in the least disconcerted by the snub he had received. About half an hour later the division bell rang, and he was sauntering through the “No” lobby with a quizzical smile on his pleasant face, when the Chancellor of the Exchequer, coming behind, took his arm in a friendly way, and drew him into one of the recesses.“Didn’t think me rude, Mirabel, I trust?” he said. “The truth is we are terribly perplexed about this infernal business. Ordinary counterfeit coins, however good the die, are of course easily detected by the metal. But now even the experts cannot tell the difference.”He took a handful of loose silver from his pocket, and jingled it in comic perplexity. “As like as not,” he went on, “one-half of these have never seen the Mint. I’ll be passing bad coin and defrauding the Exchequer when I pay for my dinner later on.”Mirabel laughed. “So long, Sir Robert, as you will play the game of finance with counters instead of coin you will be liable to this danger. When you make the value of the metal equal to the face value of the coin you will spoil the clever coiner’s little game. You don’t find any private coiner operating in gold, for example.”“The remedy would be worse than the disease,” retorted Sir Robert, a little pettishly. “You cannot fix a state price for silver any more than you can fix a state price for bread. I always wondered how a shrewd chap like you, Mirabel, took up this fad of the bimetallists. Your theory, it seems to me, reduces itself into an absurdity. ‘Let’s call half-a-crown’s worth of silver three-and-six, and things will be all right.’ No, my friend, silver must take its chance with other commodities in the open market. I find it sometimes hard to believe you are serious in this craze.”“Serious! My clear Sir Robert, I am backing my opinion for all I’m worth in the world, and that’s a tolerably big stake. I’m engaged in what I suppose you would call ‘making a corner in silver.’ I believe in the future of the white metal, and I’m buying for a rise. The price is beginning to go up pretty quick, as you are aware ““Then this private coining hasn’t hurt you?”“In one sense, no. It is undoubtedly driving up the value of silver. Now, I bought most of my stock when it was at bottom prices—a mere drug in the market—and I could clear out, if I wanted to, at a big profit. But I don’t want to. I’m still buying, and the rise in price doesn’t suit me. I am not only on the deal here at home, but I have given my orders to my branch establishments in France, Germany, and America: ‘Buy what silver you can at market prices.’ I fancy I am the biggest owner of silver in the world at the present moment.”“But you are driving up the price on yourself by this wholesale purchase.”“That’s so, but it cannot be helped. I mean to sell out at a big profit when bimetallism arrives.”“It will never arrive.”“I’ll risk that. Meanwhile the price is growing, and I got the first five millions’ worth so cheap I can afford to pay a little extra for further supplies.”“Five millions! Surely you haven’t got five millions’ worth of silver, Mirabel?”“Nearer to seven millions, Sir Robert, by this time,” Mr. Mirabel replied coolly.“Door! Door!” shouted the impatient tellers at this moment. Mr. Mirabel and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had to run for it, and they passed out amongst the last stragglers of the division into the passage at the back of the Speaker’s chair.“It’s incredible,” resumed the Chancellor of the Exchequer, a little out of breath, partly from the run, partly from amazement.“Come and see for yourself. The bank is worth seeing for its own sake. It was a big private house, you know, with the finest cellars in London. I board all my clerks there, and try and make them comfortable, and stay there myself as often as not. A bachelor, you see, can choose his own home. It’s a bit off the track, of course. I don’t care to pay a guinea a foot ground rent. But my customers don’t complain; men don’t mind trouble when they want money. Come over and lunch with me some day—any day that suits you—and I’ll show you over the big silver shop.”“Well, we’ll see about it.”“Say ‘yes’ and I think I can give you a helping hand with this coinage business.”“That’s a tempting bribe. Wait one moment.” Sir Robert stepped into the House through the entrance behind the Speaker’s chair, lurking in the shadow. “There’s nothing doing here,” he said when he came out the next moment. “Come to my room, Mirabel, and we’ll talk this over. You have no notion how important it is to us.”“Perhaps not,” Mr. Mirabel answered, as they walked down the long passage together; “but I know it is very important to me.”“Now tell me frankly,” said the Chancellor of the Exchequer, when they were alone in the room together with closed doors, “were you serious when you said you could help me to catch my coiner?”“I cannot myself, of course, but I think I might recommend you the man who can—a detective named Beck. The Scotland Yard chaps are babies to him, by all accounts.”“Beck! Beck! I think I’ve heard the name before. Why, that is the man the Duke of Southern talks so highly of!”“And the Duchess raves about; precisely.”“I’ve a good mind to try him. Do you know where he is to be had?”“He’s in the House at present, if he hasn’t left since the division. That’s what put his name into my head. I saw the placid face in the Strangers’ Gallery, when I got up to ask my question. Shall I send him to you?”“I will take it as a very great favour.”“All right. Mind that visit is booked,” and Mr. Mirabel started off in pursuit of Mr. Beck.Five minutes later Mr. Beck was closeted with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who rapidly explained what he wanted. “I don’t conceal from myself or you, Mr. Beck that it is a most difficult task. Scotland Yard has failed to find the slightest clue, though, of course, we have to put the best face on things for the public. The matter is of urgent Imperial importance, and expense is literally of no account whatever in comparison with success.”“I never bargain,” said Mr. Beck, “and I have never had any reason to complain. I’ll do my best for the work’s sake, and take my chance. This present case seems to me to resolve itself into two distinct parts. First: stop the coining. Second: catch the coiner. The first half appears simple enough if the people at the Mint will lend a hand.”“I will give you a letter to Mr. Moulton to assist you in every way. You’ll let me know from day to day how you get on. You might also communicate with Mr. Cecil Mirabel, M.P. He’s deeply interested in this matter and may be able to help you. You know Mr. Mirabel, of course?”“The Silver King! The biggest private banker in England! The man that is making the Rothschilds take a back seat. Yes, I know Mr. Mirabel.”Mr. Moulton received Mr. Beck the next day at the Mint somewhat superciliously, but he thawed when he read the warm recommendation of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.“Certainly, certainly, Mr. Beck,” he said, with as much cordiality as he could assume, but the long, thin hand he offered was limp, and the keen, cold eyes refused to have any part in his ungracious smile. “Certainly we will assist you in every way in our power.”He would have questioned Mr. Beck, but the other, in a quiet, masterful way he could assume when the occasion required took the cross-examination into his own hands.“This rival manufacture has hurt your business?” he asked.“Somewhat—not as much as is thought, I should say. It has delayed the issue of silver coinage—that’s all.”“Are you going to have a new issue soon?”“Almost at once; dated the present year of course. It would create suspicion—perhaps panic—to delay it much longer.”“Can I see the ‘press room’?” asked Mr. Beck, a little abruptly.“Certainly; this way!”Mr. Beck examined the row of huge coining presses with great care. The vast power of each of those big engines he saw was concentrated on the narrow point where the die touches the metal and gives it a new character to wear through the centuries.Then Mr. Moulton took one of the dies—a half-crown as it proved—from the steel girdle and handed it to Mr. Beck. “The coiner has the facsimile of this,” he said. “We cannot tell our own work from his.”“I think I have a plan,” said Mr. Beck musingly, “to help you in the future. It’s such a silly, simple plan, I’m half ashamed to mention it. But it ought to stop the coining, and perhaps catch the coiner. Couldn’t we have a little microscopic private mark on the die, say ‘M’ for Mint, there on the smooth part of the Queen’s neck. It should only be visible, of course, with a strong magnifying glass. The coiner could never suspect: new counterfeit coin could thus be detected at once. When the old coins are gradually called in ‘Othello’s occupation’s gone.’”Mr. Moulton professed himself delighted at the suggestion. “I’ll see about it at once,” he said.“Do nothing hastily,” cautioned Mr. Beck; “above all, keep the secret tight. If you could have one half-crown—only one, mind—made for me with the new mark, as a specimen, by to-morrow, I would call in a few days with further instructions.”Next day Mr. Beck got his specimen and professed himself delighted with the masterly way his notion had been carried out. The little ‘M’ was quite invisible to the naked eye, and perfectly distinct under a strong glass.He called straight-away to show it to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but Sir Robert was not to be seen.By sheer good luck, however, Mr. Beck caught Mr. Mirabel at the Reform Club. He took the “Silver King” aside, explained his plan to him, and showed him the specimen coin.Mr. Mirabel was unaffectedly delighted. He chuckled over the ingenuity of the plan and congratulated Mr. Beck. “So this is the first coin of the new issue,” he said, as he examined it carefully through the strong glass Mr. Beck lent him. “It’s quite a curiosity in itself; I declare it will have a historic interest when the great conspiracy is exposed.”“You can keep it if you want to,” said Mr. Beck good-naturedly; “it is of no further use to me.”“Thanks,” said Mr. Mirabel, as he pocketed the half-crown.A few days later came the new issue of silver coinage from the Mint. There was a very limited application for supplies to the banks, so great was the glut of coined silver everywhere. Even Mr. Mirabel’s bank—the “Silver House,” as it was called—took only a very small consignment.The same morning Mr. Beck walked briskly into the Bank and inquired for Mr. Mirabel. Mr. Mirabel was expected in about half an hour. While he waited Mr. Beck went to one of the compartments at the great circular counter of carved mahogany, and changed a five-pound Bank of England note.“Four sovereigns in gold, the rest in silver,” he said; “half-crowns if you have them.”Then he got away to a quiet corner and examined his eight half-crowns carefully through the strong magnifying glass.
