The sun was setting over the sprawling hacienda of the de Mendoza family, casting long shadows across the ornate courtyard. Señorita Inez de Mendoza stood by the fountain, her face etched with worry as she watched her father, Don Luis, pacing back and forth in the fading light. His once sharp mind seemed clouded, his eyes haunted by a distant sorrow.Inez had heard of the renowned detective, Craig Kennedy, and his reputation for unraveling the most perplexing mysteries. Desperate to uncover the truth behind her father's sudden descent into madness, she sent a letter requesting his assistance.As Kennedy arrived at the hacienda, he was greeted by Inez, a striking beauty with dark, expressive eyes that held a glimmer of hope amidst the shadows of uncertainty. She led him to a secluded corner of the courtyard, away from prying eyes and eager ears."Señor Kennedy, thank you for coming," Inez began, her voice hushed with urgency. "My father's condition has worsened in recent weeks. He mutters to himself, his once jovial nature replaced by a brooding silence. I fear he is being poisoned, and I suspect Señora de Moche and her son Alfonso are behind it."Kennedy studied Inez's face, noting the determination in her gaze. He nodded thoughtfully. "I will do everything in my power to uncover the truth, Señorita. But I will need your cooperation and courage to see this through."Together, Kennedy and Inez began their investigation, delving into the intricate web of family secrets and hidden motives that surrounded the de Mendoza estate. As Kennedy interviewed the household staff and scrutinized Don Luis's daily routines, a disturbing pattern began to emerge.It became apparent that Don Luis's cigarettes, a habit he had indulged in for years, were somehow tainted with a deadly substance - stramonium, a toxic plant known to induce hallucinations and erratic behavior. Kennedy surmised that the poison was being administered gradually, leading to Don Luis's mental deterioration.With Inez's help, Kennedy devised a plan to catch the culprit in the act. Using a cleverly concocted antidote to counteract the effects of the poison, Kennedy arranged for a gathering at the Beach Inn, a secluded spot where the de Mendoza family often retreated for leisure.As the evening unfolded, tension hung heavy in the air as Kennedy and Inez awaited the arrival of their suspect. Suddenly, a commotion erupted as Don Luis stumbled into the room, his eyes wild with confusion. In a swift move, Kennedy intercepted the tainted cigarette intended for Don Luis and swapped it with the antidote-laced one.As the culprit, Señora de Moche, and her son Alfonso entered the room, their faces twisted with malice, Kennedy observed their reactions closely. It was not long before Alfonso reached for the poisoned cigarette, only to be thwarted by Kennedy's quick intervention.
