Lieutenant Roderick Houston stood outside the imposing house in Hammersmith, feeling a shiver run down his spine as he gazed up at the foreboding structure. The rumors surrounding the house were well-known in the neighborhood—whispers of a ghost that haunted the halls, driving away tenants with its eerie antics. Determined to get to the bottom of the mystery that plagued the property, Houston had reached out to his old friend, the renowned scientist Mr. Flaxman Low, known for his expertise in investigating the supernatural.Low arrived at the house with an air of calm curiosity, his sharp eyes taking in every detail of the surroundings. As they stepped inside, a chill permeated the air, and Houston couldn't help but feel a sense of unease settle over him."Tell me everything you know about the ghostly occurrences in this house," Low said, his voice steady and reassuring.Houston proceeded to recount the strange phenomena that had driven away previous tenants—the unexplained sounds of footsteps in the dead of night, objects moving on their own, and a pervasive feeling of dread that seemed to linger in every corner of the house.As they began their investigation, Low set up an array of scientific instruments to monitor the environment for any anomalies. As the night fell, the house seemed to come alive with eerie noises and unsettling whispers. Houston and Low patrolled the halls, their senses heightened as they searched for any signs of the supernatural.It was during one of their rounds that they stumbled upon a hidden room, sealed off from the rest of the house. Intrigued, they broke through the barrier and entered the room, only to be met with a chilling sight—a portrait of a man with a leonine face, his eyes filled with malice and his countenance twisted in a grimace of pain.As they delved deeper into the history of the house, they uncovered the dark and tragic story of its former owner, Mr. Van Nuysen.
