The snow fell softly, blanketing the world in a hush of white on that fateful February night. Abner and Storm found themselves standing before an abandoned manor house, its once-grand facade now weathered and worn. The old country doctor, Storm, hesitated before the heavy oak door, his hand poised to knock. Abner, a man of few words but keen intuition, watched him carefully.As Storm revealed the tale of a hidden treasure in a portmanteau within the manor house, Abner's eyes narrowed in thought. The mysterious death of old Christian Lance, with his body found bound in a chair, haunted the air with whispers of deceit and treachery. Abner listened intently as Storm spun his story, the flickering candlelight casting eerie shadows on the walls.
