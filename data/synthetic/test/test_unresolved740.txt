Flaxman Low, renowned for his expertise in investigating psychical phenomena, received an urgent summons to Saddler's Croft, a secluded and eerie house nestled in the countryside of Sussex. The Corcorans, an American couple who had recently moved into the old manor, had found themselves entangled in a series of disturbing occurrences that defied rational explanation. Low wasted no time in making his way to the mysterious property, accompanied by his trusted friend, Mr. Strewd.As they approached Saddler's Croft, a sense of foreboding hung heavy in the air. The once grand estate now stood as a shadow of its former self, the ivy-covered walls whispering secrets of long-forgotten tragedies. The Corcorans greeted Low and Strewd with a mixture of relief and trepidation, eager for answers to the unexplainable events that had plagued them since their arrival.Mrs. Corcoran recounted tales of inexplicable noises in the dead of night, objects moving on their own, and a pervasive feeling of being watched by unseen eyes. Mr. Corcoran, a skeptical man by nature, could not deny the palpable sense of unease that permeated the house, despite his attempts to dismiss it as mere superstition.Low listened intently, his keen mind already piecing together the fragments of information into a coherent narrative. It became clear to him that the Corcorans had unwittingly stumbled upon a dark undercurrent of spiritual practices that had long been dormant within the walls of Saddler's Croft. The name Agapoulos, whispered in fear by the house staff, seemed to hold the key to the mysteries that plagued the estate.
