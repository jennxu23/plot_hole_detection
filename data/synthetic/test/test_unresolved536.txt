Dora sat in her cozy living room, sipping a cup of tea and flipping through a magazine when the doorbell rang. She opened the door to find the postman holding a telegram in his hand. Her heart skipped a beat as she read the urgent message from her childhood friend, Pussie. It was a cry for help, a desperate plea for someone to come to her aid in a time of great distress.Pussie's words painted a grim picture of betrayal and injustice. Her nurse, Honor Maguire, had been accused of poisoning Pussie's guardian's wife, a crime she insisted she did not commit. Pussie implored Dora to come to her side and help uncover the truth behind the tragic events that had unfolded in their small town.Without hesitation, Dora packed a bag and set off to Pussie's estate, determined to unravel the mystery and clear Honor's name. As she arrived, Pussie welcomed her with tears in her eyes, recounting the events leading up to the dreadful accusation.Pussie explained how a new governess, Miss Graham, had recently joined their household, bringing with her an air of mystery and suspicion. She also mentioned the strange behavior of Dr. Phillimore, the family physician, who had been treating Pussie's guardian's wife before her sudden and tragic death.Dora listened intently, her mind already spinning with theories and suspicions. She decided to take matters into her own hands and investigate the case herself. With Pussie's blessing, she approached Dr. Phillimore and proposed a visit to Madame Celestine, a renowned palmist in town, under the guise of seeking guidance and insight.As they sat in Madame Celestine's dimly lit parlor, the palmist studied Dora's hand with a keen eye before turning her attention to Dr. Phillimore. With a knowing look, she began to recount the secrets hidden in his palm, revealing dark intentions and hidden truths that sent a chill down Dora's spine.
