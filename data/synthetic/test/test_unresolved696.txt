Carroll Garland jolted awake in the darkness, his heart pounding in his chest. His eyes struggled to adjust to the dim moonlight filtering through the curtains, and as he blinked, he made out the silhouette of a figure moving by the foot of his bed. Adrenaline surged through him as he sat up, his voice tight with fear. "Who's there?"The figure froze, a shadowy outline against the faint light. A slow, deliberate turn revealed a man dressed in dark clothing, his features obscured by the darkness. Carroll's hands clenched into fists as he demanded, "What are you doing in my room?"The stranger turned to face Carroll, his expression unreadable. "I'm sorry to intrude, Mr. Garland," he spoke softly, his voice calm and controlled. "But I had to find it. I had to find the letter."Confusion mixed with Carroll's fear. "What letter? What are you talking about?"
