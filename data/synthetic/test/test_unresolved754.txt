On a chilly autumn evening, as the last rays of sunlight faded behind the gnarled branches of the ancient trees surrounding Konnor Old House, a sense of foreboding settled over the dilapidated mansion. The rumors of strange occurrences and eerie sightings had spread like wildfire through the nearby village, prompting the residents to keep their distance from the cursed estate.Mr. Flaxman Low, renowned for his expertise in unraveling mysteries that defied conventional explanation, received a letter from the current owner of Konnor Old House, begging for his assistance in uncovering the truth behind the disturbing events plaguing the property. Intrigued by the challenge, Low wasted no time in assembling his trusted companions, Naripse and Sullivan, to accompany him on this enigmatic investigation.As they approached the imposing facade of the mansion, a chill ran down their spines, and the air seemed to hum with an otherworldly energy. The caretaker, a weathered man named Alastair, greeted them nervously and led them inside, recounting the tales of the Shining Man and the mysterious lights that had driven previous visitors to flee in terror.Guided by Alastair's shaky lantern light, the trio explored the dark corridors and decaying rooms of Konnor Old House, searching for clues that would unravel the enigma shrouding the estate. As they delved deeper into the labyrinthine halls, they stumbled upon a hidden chamber, its walls covered in strange symbols and tribal artifacts.
