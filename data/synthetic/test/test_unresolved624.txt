It was a stormy night when Professor Augustus S.F.X. Van Dusen, also known as The Thinking Machine, was rudely awakened by the shrill ringing of the telephone. Groaning, he reached out a hand to answer it, his sharp mind already beginning to analyze the call before he even spoke a word."Professor Van Dusen," a panicked voice whispered on the other end, "I need your help. Meet me at the old house on Elm Street immediately."The abrupt end of the call left the professor intrigued. Without hesitation, he jumped out of bed, donned his signature smoking jacket and plaid cap, and set out into the stormy night.As he arrived at the dark and foreboding house on Elm Street, he noticed shadows moving behind the curtains and a faint light flickering from the basement. With curiosity piqued, he cautiously made his way to the entrance, his keen mind already piecing together the puzzle laid out before him.Inside, he found himself in a dimly lit room, where three figures awaited him. Harry Cranston, a nervous man with shifty eyes; David Ellis Burge, a suave and charming gentleman; and Richard Folsom, a burly and silent presence.The tension in the room was palpable as Harry Cranston spoke first, his voice trembling with fear. "Professor, we need your help to uncover a plot to rob the bank. There's a secret tunnel leading from this house directly to the vault. We were forced into this scheme against our will."The Thinking Machine's sharp eyes darted around the room, taking in every detailâ€”the furtive glances, the nervous gestures, the hidden agendas. With a knowing smile, he began to unravel the tangled web of deceit and betrayal.Pointing to a seemingly innocent painting on the wall, he deduced that it was a cleverly disguised safe, containing the plans for the bank robbery. Hidden within the intricate design were clues that pointed to each of the three suspects as key players in the elaborate scheme.
