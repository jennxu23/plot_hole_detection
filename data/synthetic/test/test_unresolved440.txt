In the dimly lit streets of London, the sound of horse hooves clattered against the cobblestones as a hansom cab sped through the night. Inside, a man with a dark overcoat and a shadowy hat sat silently, his face obscured in the shadows. As the cab slowed to a stop, a sudden commotion erupted outside.The driver's desperate cries echoed through the chilly night air, followed by the sickening thud of a body hitting the ground. The man in the cab had been murdered, just like a similar case that had occurred in Paris not long ago.News of the murder spread quickly, reaching the ears of the Tremarn family, who were known for their connections to the aristocracy and the claim to the Earldom. Lord Tremarn, the head of the family, felt a chill run down his spine as he read the headlines in the morning paper.Sitting in his study, a fire crackling in the hearth, Lord Tremarn was suddenly visited by a mysterious figure known simply as "the man in the corner." This enigmatic individual, with piercing eyes that seemed to see through to one's soul, presented a chilling theory.
