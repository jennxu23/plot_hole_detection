In the quiet town of Millwood, The Thinking Machine, renowned for his unparalleled deductive skills, was enjoying a rare moment of relaxation in his study when a fellow savant, Mrs. Roswell, sought his help in a rather peculiar case. Mrs. Roswell, a wealthy widow known for her exquisite taste in jewelry, had recently discovered that a small gem was missing from her prized diamond tiara, known as the Roswell tiara. What made the case even more intriguing was the fact that the tiara had been locked in a vault with a combination only known to Mrs. Roswell herself. The puzzle of how the gem could have disappeared from a seemingly impenetrable vault piqued the interest of The Thinking Machine, who agreed to take on the case.Upon arriving at Mrs. Roswell's elegant estate, The Thinking Machine was greeted by the distraught widow, who led him to the vault where the tiara was kept. The vault was a formidable steel structure, with intricate locks and mechanisms that seemed impervious to tampering. Mrs. Roswell explained that she had checked the tiara just the day before and had been shocked to discover the missing gem.With his keen eye for detail, The Thinking Machine carefully examined the vault, scrutinizing every inch for any signs of forced entry or manipulation. However, everything appeared to be in perfect order. Intrigued by the mystery, he began to question Mrs. Roswell about the events leading up to the discovery of the theft.As Mrs. Roswell recounted the events of the previous day, The Thinking Machine noticed a peculiar detail â€“ she had mentioned that her pet cockatoo, Snowball, had been acting strangely the night before. This seemingly inconsequential detail sparked a theory in The Thinking Machine's brilliant mind. He requested to see Snowball, and Mrs. Roswell led him to the ornate cage where the cockatoo resided.Observing Snowball closely, The Thinking Machine noticed a peculiar glint in the bird's eye. Curious, he reached into the cage and gently coaxed Snowball onto his finger. To Mrs. Roswell's surprise, The Thinking Machine deftly extracted a small gemstone from the bird's beak. It was the missing gem from the Roswell tiara.
