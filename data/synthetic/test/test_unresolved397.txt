Dr. Walter Ballard stood at the gates of the sprawling estate that had once belonged to his vindictive grandfather, a man who had left behind a legacy of bitterness and secrets. Determined to uncover the hidden fortune of one million dollars in gold and United States bonds, Dr. Ballard sought the help of the brilliant and eccentric scientist, Professor Augustus S.F.X. Van Dusen, also known as The Thinking Machine.As Dr. Ballard entered the cluttered laboratory of The Thinking Machine, he was met with the sight of the scientist hunched over a microscope, his wild, straw-colored hair standing on end. Without preamble, Dr. Ballard explained the mysterious circumstances surrounding his grandfather's death and the elusive fortune that lay hidden somewhere on the estate.The Thinking Machine listened intently, his piercing blue eyes darting back and forth as he processed the information. "We shall approach this problem with logic and observation," he declared. "Let us first examine any clues left behind by your grandfather."Together, they combed through the meager belongings of the deceased man, searching for any hint that could lead them to the hidden treasure. The Thinking Machine's keen eye caught on a faded photograph of the grandfather with his beloved pet parrot and dog. "Animals can often hold the key to their owners' secrets," mused The Thinking Machine. "Let us visit the widow who has custody of the parrot and dog."At the widow's humble abode, they were greeted by a cacophony of squawks and barks as the parrot and dog vied for attention. The parrot, with its colorful plumage and sharp wit, immediately caught The Thinking Machine's interest. He observed the bird closely, noting its repeated phrases and gestures.After spending hours studying the behavior of the parrot and dog, The Thinking Machine made a startling deduction.
