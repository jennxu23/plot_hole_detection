Dora Myrl was known far and wide for her sharp mind and keen observation skills. She had solved many challenging cases in her career as a detective, but the case of the missing violin presented a unique set of challenges. The violin in question was not just any violinâ€”it was a priceless instrument crafted by the legendary Nicolo Amati himself. When news broke that the violin had gone missing from the hands of the renowned violinist, the music world was in an uproar.Dora wasted no time in taking on the case. She knew that time was of the essence when it came to recovering the valuable instrument. With her trusty friend Sylvia by her side, Dora began her investigation. The first step was to interview Nicolo Amati himself to gather as much information about the violin and its disappearance as possible.Amati was distraught over the loss of his prized possession. He explained to Dora and Sylvia that the violin had been entrusted to the care of Monsieur Gallasseau, a charming but enigmatic figure in the music world. Gallasseau had promised to display the violin at a prestigious event, but when the time came, the violin was nowhere to be found.Dora's intuition told her that Monsieur Gallasseau was not being entirely truthful. She decided to pay him a visit at his elegant townhouse to see if she could uncover any clues. Gallasseau welcomed Dora and Sylvia with a suave smile, but there was a glint of something sinister in his eyes.As they sat in Gallasseau's opulent parlor, Dora noticed a small, intricately carved music box on a side table. The melody it played was hauntingly beautiful, and Dora's keen ear recognized it as a piece often played on the missing violin. She subtly steered the conversation towards the music box, and Gallasseau's reaction confirmed her suspicions.With a clever ploy, Dora distracted Gallasseau long enough for Sylvia to discreetly examine the music box.
