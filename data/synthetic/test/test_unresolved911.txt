The Thornvale Hotel stood nestled amidst rolling hills, its grand facade a stark contrast to the lush green of the surrounding golf course. Miss Mag Hazel, a young woman of striking beauty and quick wit, had come to Thornvale seeking solace in the peaceful game of golf. Little did she know that her stay at the hotel would unravel a mystery that would change the course of her life forever.From the moment she arrived, Mag found herself drawn into a world of intrigue and secrets. Mr Hawkins, a wealthy diamond merchant with a charming smile and a reputation for lavish gifts, took a particular interest in her. His attentions both flattered and unnerved her, and she found herself torn between his affections and the magnetic pull of Mr Ryan, a dashing young engineer with a rebellious streak.As Mag navigated the intricate social dynamics of the hotel, she couldn't shake the feeling that danger lurked just beneath the surface. Gossip whispered of hidden alliances and simmering rivalries, and she couldn't help but wonder if she was walking into a trap.
