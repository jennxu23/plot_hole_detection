Dr. Alexander Grant paced back and forth in his office, the ticking of the clock on the wall mocking him with each passing second. Dora, the love of his life, was set to sail for Europe the next morning, and he had made a promise to reconcile with her before she embarked on her journey. But fate had other plans for him.As he gathered his coat and hurried out into the chilly night, a shadow fell over him. A tall, mysterious man emerged from the darkness, his eyes gleaming with an unsettling intensity. Before Alex could react, the man grabbed him and dragged him into a nearby building, locking the door behind them.Panic gripped Alex as he realized he was trapped in a room with no way out. Frantic, he pounded on the door, shouting for help, but no one came to his aid. Hours passed like an eternity, and he could do nothing but wait, consumed by anger and despair.As dawn broke, the door creaked open, and the mysterious man stood before him once more. Without a word, he released Alex and disappeared into the shadows, leaving behind a bewildered and disheveled doctor.Racing against time, Alex dashed to the dock where Dora's ship was scheduled to depart. But as he arrived, his heart shattered into a million pieces. There she was, standing with another man, her laughter floating on the breeze like a cruel taunt. The realization hit him like a sledgehammer â€“ he had lost her forever.Heartbroken and devastated, Alex turned away, unable to bear the sight any longer. He wandered the streets aimlessly, his thoughts consumed by grief and regret. Little did he know that the night's events were far from over.Upon returning to the city, news of a tragic explosion shook the community. Richter, his trusted partner, had been killed in a dreadful accident caused by an infernal machine. The shock of the loss left Alex reeling, grappling with the cruel hand fate had dealt him.In the midst of his despair, a letter arrived at his doorstep, a faint glimmer of hope in the darkness that surrounded him. With trembling hands, he tore it open and read the words that would change everything.
