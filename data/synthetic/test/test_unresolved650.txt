The sun was setting over the grand Roswell estate as Mrs. Roswell paced nervously in the opulent drawing room. Her step-daughter, Jeanette, stood silently by the window, her face clouded with worry. In the center of the room, The Thinking Machine sat in his usual chair, his sharp eyes darting around the room, taking in every detail."Mrs. Roswell, please tell me everything you can about the missing diamond from the tiara," The Thinking Machine requested, his voice as precise as ever.Mrs. Roswell took a deep breath before beginning her tale. "It was a week ago that we discovered the diamond was missing from the tiara. The tiara was kept in a locked vault in my dressing room, and the key was always in my possession. No one else could have accessed it. However, the diamond simply vanished without a trace."The Thinking Machine nodded thoughtfully. "And who else knew about the diamond? Anyone who might have had a motive to take it?"Mrs. Roswell hesitated before answering. "Well, Jeanette knew about the tiara, of course. She's always had a fascination with jewelry. But I can't believe she would steal from her own family."The Thinking Machine turned his piercing gaze towards Jeanette. "And what do you have to say for yourself, Miss Jeanette?"Tears welled up in Jeanette's eyes as she spoke. "I swear I had nothing to do with it. I would never betray my family in such a way."The Thinking Machine remained silent for a moment, deep in thought. Suddenly, he stood up and announced, "I believe I have solved the mystery of the missing diamond."Both Mrs. Roswell and Jeanette looked at him in astonishment. The Thinking Machine beckoned for them to follow him as he led the way to the dressing room where the vault was kept. He examined the lock and the surrounding area with meticulous precision.
